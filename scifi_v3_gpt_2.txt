He comes to me in pieces as I watch the stillness of space, envisioning new constellations in the array of unrecognized stars. I trace the sparks of light with my finger, connecting the dots and smudging the glass as a result.  
How many stars do you think there are in space? I imagine him asking. Can there really be other ones out there as big as or even bigger than the sun? 
I always admired his genuine curiosity, how he viewed things with a particular interest, how he saw me. He was the one that organized our sleepovers, the one that nudged me to sign up for afterschool activities such as the chemistry club and the robotics team.  
Can you build me a mechanical arm that'll change the channels on the TV's remote, so that way I don't have to? He once asked sarcastically. How about a drone that we can use to spy inside the girls' locker room, huh? Wouldn't that be neat? 
When we were kids, he would give me piggyback rides and run with me through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. We'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, he'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with his crooked teeth.
That was fun, wasn't it?  
Our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the August sun. He'd take me to his baseball team's practices, and I'd watch him bat while I built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers.
Booyah! He'd shout after a home run. I'd cheer or clap, and he would always gleam and say the same thing. It's going, it's going, gone. Kiss that puppy goodbye.
A few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for leather jackets and motorcycle rides on the empty freeway. He and I would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. We'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.  
I'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town, he'd always say. How about you?
I don't know. I shrugged. Maybe I'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm.
What? Come on, man, you got to apply for university too. You're a freakin brainiac. I'm sure you could get into any school.
Out the bay window, I see the lunar triplets: Euphrosyne, Aglia, and Thalia dancing around what the New Worlds Association likes to call Undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to Jupiter, that I've been studying for what would be measured, on planet Earth, as eight months. 
The journey to this specific star system took four years. The rest of the crew and I have enough resources to last another sixteen Earth months. By then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. Our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. A decade, that's how long we'll have been apart. 
So you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years? 
I assured him that it was completely safe, that I wouldn't die in transport. 
But doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? Won't you technically be younger than me?
I think about his current age. How it's already been more than four years, and how unfair it must have seemed to him; that he'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while I'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.   
Sometimes I wonder if he tells his other friends and customers about me. My buddy's up in space, I imagine him saying. What's he doing up there? He's researching a new planet, someplace better than this shit hole we're destroying. 
Undine registers an oxygen signature similar to Europa and planet Earth. The oceanic surface covering the entire planet could host a form of phytoplankton or an entirely new plant species capable of producing oxygen as a byproduct of their natural photosynthetic process. In other words, Undine could, in theory, host life. 
If I'm being honest with myself, sometimes I feel that my role on this ship isn't as relevant as the other crew members' works. That perhaps what I'm doing isn't as impacting, that it's less exciting. I'm not spacewalking or trying to merge chemical compounds under zero-gravity conditions. I barely passed the physical exam, and my score on the simulatory emergency program ranked me as the fifth in command if anything were to happen to our pilot or the others of my crew.  
So what? He'd fire. You'll still be one of the few guys part of the human race to have ever gone up to space. You'll still have broken records, be mentioned in the history books. You'll have gone places no one has ever been to. 
It was always like him to see the bright side in situations. When he didn't get his full-ride to college, he applied for the town's undergrad program at the local college. Don't worry, man, I'm still going to make it back and get myself out of this place.
When he couldn't juggle both his academic life and work to help his folks pay the bills, he still didn't crumble under all the pressure. I'll take a break this semester, and then on the next one, I'll go back. 
He never returned to school to finish his undergrad. Maybe college just isn't for me. He opted to continue working, helping out his folks, and eventually went to, and finished, trade school. I'm thinking about opening a restaurant. He told me years ago. What about you, what are you thinking about doing with your life, huh, Mr. Big Shot Imma certified scientist?
I laughed at his remark. I don't know, I answered. I guess I could teach or go for my Ph.D.
What? But you just finished school, now you're thinking about going back? He commented while scratching his beard. He tugged on the bill of his baseball cap and shook his head in disapproval. You're nuts, man! 
Yeah? And what do you think I should do?
If I were as wicked smart as you, I'd go to the moon!
Scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. He heard about a space program from one of his faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a BLT for the road.
He told me how the New Worlds Association was looking for people to blast off, in his own words, into space. That the money I'd receive would leave me set for life.  
He was the one that showed me the association's website. It says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. Does that sound like something you could do?
Huh? I was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown. I think so, I answered, correcting myself. But —
But what if I get accepted? That's what I should have asked. But what if they don't think I'm qualified enough? What if I'm rejected?
Then they're crazy, he snapped back. You're the most intelligent person I know! No way, they'd reject you. 
I pitched him my project several times, letting him serve as my judge and jury. The idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of Undine. 
Do you mean like a robotic hand?
Exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone, I said. A machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. If the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. Some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us. 
He stared at me for a few seconds, his eyes wide and his mouth nearly dangling from his jaw like a bell. 
So...what do you think?
I think you're going into space. 
The admiration in his eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy. Who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return?
The probe, Michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter Undine's domain in approximately two weeks. From our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. That's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. I'll have to watch over Michaelangelo as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. I'll also have to frequently analyze Undine's tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as Michaelangelo departs from the spacecraft.
Do you think Michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece? he asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog.
I think so. I'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission.
Knowing you'll be the one to build him, I'm sure he'll be great! No, I'm wrong. Michaelangelo will be better than great. He'll be fucking perfect.  
I'm glad one of us is feeling confident, I returned, leaning back into his sofa. He plopped himself right beside me, threw his arm over my neck, and pulled me into his orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. He flipped himself over, partially resting his chest over mine, don't be so hard on yourself. I believe in you.
I'll miss you, you know that, right? I gushed. We hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. My eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever I think of him.
Hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? You'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet Earth.  
Onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. We have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions. 
They all sound like show-offs, that's what! 
There's also a physicist and a botanist. Our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and Mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as he'd like to say. 
A certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space. 
Weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass. You're going to do big things up there, he said. He turned and shined me his crooked smile. And when you're back, everyone is going to know your name. 
You know I don't care about any of that stuff. I'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons.
I swear, man, only you.  
Everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. Our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. When they turn to me and ask if I've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's him.  
I'm the quiet one up here. Space is already deathly silent, but it and I enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus Undine's three moons. I watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. Obviously, there'd be no sound, but I'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow.
In this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. The lone star is distant from everything, the same way that I'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.   
How do you think things will be like once I'm back? I asked him before I left for my physical and mental training. 
What do you mean? He returned. 
Will we still be —
You're kidding, right? Come on, I know you're smarter than that. 
He hugged me, and for a moment, I wished he had begged me not to go. I considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon. 
Promise me you'll be here when I get back.
I wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. I'll be here waiting for you. Me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon. 
At times I question myself. What's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land? And I'll hear him saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the Maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from Earth just like Noah's Ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island. Who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like The Atlanteans?
I'll nod and chuckle to myself and say sure as if it's all so simple. I'll picture us both on Undine drifting together in its never-ending pool. He and I, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with Michaelangelo. 
Before I left, he gave me an envelope, open it only once you're far away from Earth. It's because of what he wrote that I know I'll return, that I'll tell him everything, from what I saw to what I dreamt. I'll say how much I remembered, how much I missed him, and I'll repeat the exact verse he wrote at the end of his letter; three words more significant to me than Undine and its three moons.

I am spinning slowly in my tank, suspended in doped-up air, buoyant, bobbing. Piano music (Beethoven?) plays softly in the background. My eyes are closed, but if I opened them, I would see only pale yellow light enclosing me in a warm glow.
I like the piano music. It makes me feel calm. That, alongside the sedation. The Facility keeps mine light, because I prefer it that way, and because I am well-behaved. The Facility knows my ways, knows I don’t misbehave. I have been here for a long time now. It must be years, though there is no sense of time. No calendar, no clock. Only the pale light washing over me, keeping me warm. 
This morning, the Facility reminded me that my son will visit me today. He comes every week, at the same time. While the staff prepare me for his visit, they tell me he is good to me, compared to most of the others in here, at the Blessed Home facility, whose families have forgotten them. I nod and smile gently, murmuring the right response. They think my mind is feeble, like so many in here. I cannot see outside my tank, but the Facility can see inside, so I stay locked inside my mind. They cannot see inside my mind. In my mind, I am not suspended in a tank of gas and air. I go away, far from here.
Where do I go? I go home, to my sprawling house in the countryside, with a red-tiled roof and ivy-covered archway, the mishmash of furniture and ornaments, collected over a lifetime, heavy with memories. For sixty years, my wife and I lived there, raised our child and grew old. We had a black cat with a white tummy called Cat Stevens. But then my wife died and my only son accused me of going senile.
The bell that signals that my sedation has stopped chimes. Soon, they will come to collect me. I stop spinning as the air thins and I float to the bottom of the tank. I wait.
A pop of glass opening, bright light seeps inside. A gentle hand the length of my body picks me up from under my arms and seats me in a dollhouse armchair. I watch as the giant girl in the Facility's uniform scrubs her hands in a sink as large as a swimming pool. She is a kind of nurse, I think. My wife was a nurse, though in our day, the Facility didn’t exist. I am handed a pair of sunglasses while my eyes adjust to the natural light. 
“How are you feeling today, Mr Donnelly?” her voice booms.
I mumble something as she dresses me. When I first arrived, I was embarrassed by foreign hands touching my body, stripping me bare, clothing me in strange scratchy Facility clothes. But now, I am apathetic. Maybe it’s the drugs. 
When I am presentable, she brings me to the visiting area. I sit in an armchair, more comfortable than the last, watching vast visitors speak to their doll-sized relatives. I once heard a story about a family who brought home their shrunken grandma from the Facility, only to have her chewed up by her once beloved dog.
My son comes into view, striding towards me with confident steps. I used to walk like that too, before I came to the Facility. He plants himself squarely in the visitor’s chair, launching into a nervous segment on his drive here, and the audacity of other drivers, and how isn’t it ridiculous that with all the technological advancements in the world, we still don’t have cars that drive the middle class from A to B?
While he talks, I let my mind drift. I used to be angry at him for forcing me to come here. Of course, he needed consent, but the pressure, financial and emotional, forced my hand. He threw all kinds of arguments at me; overpopulation, nursing homes. I used to wonder if he wanted to punish me, if I was a bad father, if I shouted too much, if I pushed him too far, if he resented me. 
I don’t wonder anymore. I don’t do anything much. The end is coming soon; I can tell by the way my body submit to sedation. I asked them to lighten it, because I know I will sleep for a long time, soon. I want to comb over my memories of home, before I go on to whatever lies beyond. I wish I was going home. But I’ll never go home again. 
The thirty-minute drive to my father’s facility is the most inconvenient part of my week. I swear as I swerve around incompetent idiots, blaring the horn and flipping off scandalised old ladies who surely shouldn't have licenses anyway. It’s amazing with all the advancements in technology, I still have to drive myself to get where I need to go. I take my anger out on the road, so that by the time I get to Blessed Home, I am wrung dry of emotion.
I first heard about it when my father was getting too senile to live at home, and we were looking at nursing homes for him. But the demand is competitive, the prices obscene, the facilities bad. I didn’t want him to be abused and neglected, and he flat out refused to go to a nursing home. Pulled the “what would your mother think?” line too. 
Someone told me about this facility. They had seen it on the dark web. I brought my father here for a consultation. They welcomed us warmly, offered us coffee, spewed us with medical jargon. We toured the premises as they explained the basics of the technology, how it was possible to reduce the size of a person using extreme heat pressure to the size of a ragdoll, while preserving their body and mind. They showed us to a vault, where little old people bobbing in silver containers lined the walls, sleeping. They described the benefits - fewer drugs needed, less food, less waste, easier to manage large numbers of people, easy storage. They were sedated the majority of the time, woken at various intervals to eat, to exercise, to excrete.
He wasn’t convinced. But because the nursing home was a no-go, it was easier to convince him to try. That was all we needed. Left with no other option, he signed his life away. I promised to visit him every week. I have never broken that promise. 
The facility is spotlessly white. The receptionist flashes me an expensive smile.
“Welcome to Blessed Home, Mr Donnelly. Go right ahead.”
They always have him ready to see me as soon as I arrive. During his former life, he was a big man, looming, powerful. A blue-collar labourer who wanted a better life for his son. His presence, hell, his shadow, used to scare me. Now, as I walk towards him, he is miniscule, deflated. He looks tired. He always looks tired.
I tell him about my week. He listens, or doesn’t. I can’t tell, because he nods and murmurs at the right times, but never asks me questions. I never ask him how he is doing. I know he does nothing. He goes back into the vat of drugged up air and bobs around for hours, days, left with nothing but his own fading memories and medicated slumber. 
Do I feel ashamed? I don’t dwell on it for long enough to feel anything but relief. I don’t have to sacrifice my life to look after him, or remortgage my house to fund his last years. I don’t feel guilty, because I’m not alone. Thousands of families send their elderly, dying relatives to these facilities, which have sprung up all over the country. It’s normalised now. So it must be OK.
At the end of our hour together, I always turn away, so I won’t have to look at him being lifted like a baby back into the vault. I wonder if he ever misses his home, the old house with the rusty roof and overgrown garden, sold to pay the price to live in a tank. After drinking alone one evening, filled with morbid curiosity, I drove by. Bleary eyed, I noted a strange car in the driveway. The lawn was mowed, the roof replaced, the door painted a happy yellow. I wanted to stop and knock on the door. But I didn't. I looked away, eyes on the road, and kept driving. 
He must know that he will never see it again. He will die in this godforsaken place I put him in. The irony of naming this little piece of hell "Blessed Home" makes me shiver. I wonder if his mind is past the point of knowing, or if he knows more than he lets on. I could ruminate on whether I did the right thing, but what good would it do?
The Blessed Home facility grows smaller as I drive away, and I forget, for another week at least.

Something wasn’t right.
The farmer’s market buzzed around him, his arms heavy with his cloth totes filled to the brim. There’d been a lovely selection of candles this morning. Now he waited among the sea of humanity in the square for the curly-haired vendor to wrap his fresh-cut flowers. An acoustic band played in the middle of the market, twangy notes bouncing off tents and muddled with the voices of the crowd. He reached out for his wrapped bouquet with a smile while alarm bells rang in his head.
It seemed like a pleasant day- from all the available information, it was. Yet every time he turned a corner, every time he bumped into someone and mumbled his apologies, he felt as if eyes were burning into the back of his skull. He checked his breath rate and found it functionally normal. He tested his blinking mod and found no concerns. Still, as he weaved through the market, he zoned in on the port-o-johns and stood in line as calmly as he could.
When he finally made it inside, he closed his eyes and scanned. No functions seemed abnormal. Still, with his sensory circuits firing so much today, he decided it best to do a soft reboot. Candles heavy in his arms, the flowers peeking over the sides of his totes, he stood still in the port-o-john and let his CPU reset.
A few functions stuttered at first; mostly the modifications he’d added in the last few years, like the blinking mod. After a second or two, they all hummed quietly into order, evening out their memory usage. Response time under a second. Respiratory simulation at a resting rate of fourteen breaths a minute. Blinking mod pushing a blink every seven seconds. Nothing out of order. He let his shoulders relax and flushed the toilet behind him. There’d be no way to differentiate him from anyone else. Couldn’t be. He exited the port-o-john and tried to push the feelings away. Maybe it was time to leave the market.
He headed down the street at a leisurely pace, careful not to seem in any hurry. After all, if for some reason it wasn’t his sensory awareness misfiring, it’d be best to not to appear paranoid. There’d be no reason for a man visiting the farmer’s market on a beautiful morning to think he was being followed. Even in this train of thought, he reassured himself that being followed wasn’t likely. Why let it ruin the day?
Whether to throw off his pursuers or to force himself to abandon the silly thoughts, he took a detour on the way back to his apartment. He stopped in at the local gardening center, where the shopkeep knew him by his fake name and bought a new spider plant. Now, his arms and hands full, he walked a little quicker towards his complex. He told himself it was to get the snake plant inside, but he knew fear chased his footsteps.
The doorman greeted him as he stepped through the door. He nodded once, the snake plant’s hanging leaves jostling as he pulled out his resident card. Only when walking up the stairs to his third floor studio did he relax.
A neighbor, Mrs. Whistledown, waved in the hallway. He smiled and greeted her as he shuffled his things to unlock the door. Once inside, he let the totes fall to the ground and set the snake plant in the windowsill. Then he leaned against the wall and put his head in his hands. The alarm bells were quieter now that he was inside. Locked in. Safe. His apartment complex was the safest place he could be. So why were the alarms only quieter and not gone?
Something at the market must have been off. Off in a way that his logic systems had found dangerous. It would take hours to sift through the raw data to find what had triggered it. Hours of audio, of video, all having to be sifted through to find what had gone wrong. He looked at his apartment and sighed. He wouldn’t be able to go into rest mode until he’d found it, he knew that. With a heavy dose of trepidation, he started the script to find the trigger.
While the script ran, he unloaded his haul from the farmer’s market. He picked a purple candle and placed it on his dining table, stacking the others in careful towers in his closet. He unwrapped the bouquet, grabbing a packet of plant food from his cabinet and a vase. He filled a vase with water, mixed in the plant food, and arranged the flowers. Then he grabbed his watering can and sprayer and set to watering his plants.
First the rubber plant, Henry. Henry needed a good misting during the warm months and he obliged, spraying each leaf evenly. Then Alberta, the Boston fern. Next were the lavender and mint pots, Lila and Pepper. And down the line he went, each plant with a different name, both scientific and given. Just like him. All the while the script ran in his head, tackling all the audio from his trip out and flagging bits of interest. So far, none stood out as significant. He tipped the watering can over Susanna, the lilies, just as a knock interrupted him. The script stopped. His hand froze.
He wasn’t expecting company.
The watering can and sprayer were near silent as he set them down next to his plant family. He stepped carefully towards the door, mindful of the wooden floor’s bends so as not to let the squeaks of the wood give away his position. When he arrived at the door, he stood just off to the side, hiding the shadow of his bare feet from underneath. He leaned over to look through the peephole.
A trade worker of some sort stood outside, coveralls and matching hat. She chewed on something in her mouth, looking down the hall, tapping her toolbox with one finger. The alarm bells were back. The mechanic knocked again.
He saw little choice in the matter. “Who is it?” he called through the door.
The woman turned her attention to his door. “Electrician. Got word from Mrs. Carol that there were some busted wires in the apartment above yours. I need access to your ceiling.”
Mrs. Carol sent her? The landlady usually gave notices for work orders, but if it was the apartment above his, maybe she hadn’t known.
He’d hate to inconvenience Mrs. Carol due to his own paranoia. His limbs tense, alarm straightening his spine, he opened the door.
A bright flash blasted his ocular systems and he felt an electrical pulse surge through his body, overloading his wiring. The world faded into hot-white nothingness.
The first systems that fired back up were his logic systems. The electrician wasn’t an electrician. He’d been hit by a pulse gun. He was in danger.
Next were his motor skills. He found both his arms and legs unresponsive. Still attached, he found from pinging each limb. Just individually restricted. Either he was in restraints or his attacker knew how to manipulate droids.
His microphones were back online. He heard his attacker shuffling through his apartment, tinkering with something. Otherwise quiet. His voice box was back online as well, but he held off trying to talk until he could see.
Slowly all other systems went online, one at a time, but he knew his ocular cameras would be the last to load. He kept still, though he knew he couldn’t feign unconsciousness. All she’d have to do is listen and she’d hear the quiet whirring in his chest, his android heartbeat.
When his ocular systems were back online, he opened his eyelids to a slit. His attacker sat in front of him, tinkering with a-
Oh no. An external monitor.
Her eyes caught his and he stopped hiding. He opened his eyes and sat as straight as he could only having control of his torso and neck. He found his neck jangled slightly. Dread crept along his spine. She’d opened his casing while he was out. The external monitor-
“Make this easy for me,” she said, waving the monitor in her hand, “Give me your serial number.”
He pursed his lips and said nothing.
She sighed. “Listen. You found a way to burn off your serial number, which, props, clever. But I don’t get paid the big bucks for nothing. I can hack you and find it. I’d just rather not.”
He stared at her. Waiting.
“You know why I’m here, right?” she asked.
He nodded.
“Then you know who sent me. Which is why I’d really rather not hack you. So, y’know, a serial number would be nice.”
“You don’t have to do this,” he whispered.
“I kinda do,” she said, rubbing her forehead, “I was paid half up front.”
“I’m-” He hesitated, rolling the word around in his head before letting it pass his lips, “I’m sentient.”
She rolled her eyes and, if he’d had a stomach, it would’ve dropped. “Sure, and I’m the Queen of England.”
“What did they tell you I was?” he asked, trying not to let panic into his voice.
“A spy droid,” she said, pulling some cords out of her bag, “So I knew you’d lie. It’s, like, the point of you.”
There was no holding back the panic now. They’d trapped him. Nothing he said would make a difference. She was here to take him back and it wouldn’t matter what he said.
“Please,” he said, pushing his head forward, “Please, I truly am sentient, it’s why they’ve been hunting me, it’s why I’ve-”
“Oh shut it, ya big baby. You’re caught. I’m not Russia here to steal your secrets, I just wanted your serial number.”
“Please, miss, I’m not a spy, I’m a record keeper, I-”
She stood, cords dangling from the monitor. His mouth hung open in helplessness. It was over. All of it, the years in hiding, the life he’d built- over.
“Well, no point in dragging this out I guess. Night-night, pal,” she said.
Her hands with the cords reached around his neck. He felt the first plug inserted and the world went dark.
Cybil typed a few commands into the monitor as the droid slumped over. Finally. She hadn’t taken out spy droids before but the way they talked was creepy. Almost human. The “please” was what really got her. She shivered. Government droids were good.
With a few more keystrokes, the serial number popped up on the screen. She pulled out her contract to compare the two. Perfect match. Burning off his own serial number had been smart, but she’d been a mechanic for droids before- a little damage couldn’t stop her from the info she needed.
Looking around the apartment, she did find that the price the government was paying for this one seemed steep. The hardest part had been finding him, honestly. Usually rogue droids gave her more of a fight, tried to run or self-destruct. They also didn’t buy fresh flowers at the farmer’s market or keep a well-decorated apartment. This one had just keeled over with one pulse after opening the door and said “please”.
Her mind wondered about its logic systems. What kind of programming made a droid keep plants? The contract said it was a spy droid- were they made to try and blend in? Surely a little peek at the code wouldn’t hurt. It’s not like she was looking through its documents or info caches.
She typed in a command prompt to bring up the logic systems code. The screen blipped at her. “Command not found.” Weird. She tried another command, one that worked for the last generation of droids. “Command not found.” Super weird. Maybe if she knew the droid’s model she could figure it out. She brought up the system info and brought up the model number: ALN23061912RK.
Geeze. ALN? That was… old. Real old. And the numbers, the designation- RK. That didn’t sound like a spy droid. RK. What would an RK bot-
The droid’s last words echoed in her thoughts. “I’m a record keeper.”
Cybil dropped the monitor and scrambled away from the prone droid. A bot, at least fifteen years old, government issue, and a record keeper had lied? Said please? It shouldn’t have had programming that would allow that. Record keepers stored information, they weren’t supposed to simulate emotion or tell lies. It defeated the purpose. She pulled out her contract again, scrolling through the datapad to confirm she hadn’t read it wrong. They’d sent her to hunt a spy droid. A spy droid with the serial number she’d just confirmed was this bot’s. But this bot was a record keeper. A record keeper that kept a veritable jungle of plants on his windowsill, shopped at the farmer’s market and asked her to spare its existence.
She wasn’t surprised the government had lied- it usually did to hide its true intentions around why the bot was to be eliminated or brought in. But this was- she’d stumbled on to something, she was sure of it, but wasn’t sure what.
The monitor on the floor blinked at her. She reached forward, fingers shaking, to see what had appeared on the screen. The command prompts were back up. But instead of a command, one word had been typed:
PLEASE
Cybil’s hands shook harder. She took a deep breath and typed back: WHAT
Each letter that appeared felt heavy, forced: MY PLANTS
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLANTS, she replied.
THEYLL DIE IF YOU TAKE ME
Cybil bit at her bottom lip, feeling sweat bead at her forehead.
PLEASE PUT THEM IN THE HALL SO MRS CAROL FINDS THEM I DONT WANT THEM TO DIE
“Oh fuck this,” she said, standing up. She began to pace.
PLEASE blinked up at her from the monitor and she thought.
The first systems back up were his logic systems. He was still alive. She no longer was hacking him. He was still in danger. Other than that, his knowledge of what was happening was terrifyingly empty. He’d thought when he went under, he’d never come up again. There was some relief in being able to think for himself again.
“Can you hear me yet?”
Yes, he thought, my mic’s back up. But my voice box-
“Shit, you’re old, maybe you’re still booting.”
Old? Had she-?
She’d looked at his model number. Hope sprang in his chest with the whirring of his electric heartbeat.
His voice box was back online. “I can hear you.”
He could also hear her moving things. Heavy things. Back and forth through his apartment. He waited anxiously as his camera systems revved up, meanwhile testing his hands and feet cautiously. His toes wiggled. His fists clenched and unclenched. The alarm bells had stopped, now only hope and awe at his ability to move, to think remained. He was being spared.
When his cameras returned, he opened his eyes to see half his apartment packed into his suitcases in the middle of the living room. He reached back and felt the back of his neck- blissfully closed.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“You can’t stay here,” she said, throwing one of his suits from the closet into a crumpled heap, “If I found you, others will. I’m one of the best, but I’m only one of.”
“You’re letting me go?”
“No record keeper droid can lie. Or has such a strong will that they can communicate while being hacked. Or,” she waved her hand at the ferns and vines and flowers that adorned his window, “Keeps plants just because they like them.”
“You believe me.”
“Don’t push it, pal,” she said, returning to throwing items into his suitcases, “I’m not exactly a fan of all this.”
He attempted to stand but found his systems confused and fell. She was beside him in an instant, leaning him back against the wall.
“None of that now,” she said, her voice gentle, “I just hacked you. You’re old. It might take you a while to recover.”
“Thank you,” he said, closing his eyes. He listened to her stand and continue packing.
“Now, if you want my advice, you need more mods,” she said from across the apartment, “Your skin is too perfect and you don’t fidget. That’s how I could pick you out of a crowd. You clearly had work done since you escaped so I assume you can figure out how to get those.”
He nodded, silent, and watched her throw his self-repair kit into a suitcase pocket.
“And another thing. Don’t work in accounting. I know you want to use your record keeping skills, but maybe apply them to something else. Like, I don’t know, work at a library or something. Just make sure you make mistakes. And take a sick day or two. Hell, get fired. That makes you look more human.”
He stood, shaking, and helped her finish packing. He was slower, but she didn’t complain. When they were done, he stood at the door.
“I’ll take care of your plants a few days,” she said, looking back, “And keep them off your back for a week or two. Then I’ll take these to Mrs. Carol.”
He nodded, looking at his plants. Henry. Alberta. Susanna. He looked at her, standing in front of them, hands on her waist.
“You’ll be okay?”
Her eyes widened. Then she laughed.
“Yeah. I know how to get out of contracts. Thanks.”
He nodded and turned to leave.
“Oh, hey, real quick?”
He glanced back over his shoulder.
“What do you call yourself?” she asked, “Er, like, what’s your name?”
“Alan,” he said, “Like my model number.”
“Alan.” She nodded, “Be safe for me, Alan. Please.”
Alan smiled and walked down the hall and into the night, free to try living again. Maybe he’d open a flower shop this time.

It had been more than a month since Otto had last used remote controlled explosives to break into a building and he’d forgotten how bright the blast was. Bright, but nearly silent, with glass and debris drawn into the explosion without a sound. The wonders of new technology. 
Otto led the way in, ducking through his newly made entrance hole. His colleague, Kessie, followed behind, a hand on her rifle. Some of the colleagues he had since removed judged it strange that they still carried 21st century guns, antiques of when wars were fought between huge human militaries. They’d wanted to employ bots or hack their way to money. But Otto had been in the business a long time, and there was many a time when a bullet to the head of a man or robot had saved his life. He’d never trust a bot to fight for him, even if he was controlling it, and he didn’t like the gangs that worked from behind computer desks. There was something blood-racing, delicious, irreplaceable about smashing and sneaking your own way into a building to make a living. No one did it like he did anymore. No one thought of stealing the robots that were used as workers everywhere now; at least no one he’d ever heard of in London. 
This old building had been quite the spot by Kessie - a grand, sprawling restaurant, complete with arches, pillars, spiral staircases, and now, Otto could see, glass chandeliers and lush oil paintings. The best part about the place was that Kessie reported it to be empty of humans. Otto surveyed the interior, rubbing his hands together. It was true. Not a bodyguard or customer in sight. 
A distant shuffling sound whispered a warning. Otto drew a breath. Maybe someone was here after all. A door creaked, and slow footsteps echoed in the quiet. 
They were in an entrance room, a sign on a post that asked them politely: ‘Please wait to be seated’. Otto guessed there were probably lots of different floors and halls in the restaurant. It made it hard to tell where the steps could be coming from. They were getting louder. 
“What do we do?” Kessie stared at him. She raised her gun towards the nearest doorway. 
“Shoot them.” Otto shook his head. “If it’s just one guy we’ll be ok.” He slid behind an empty plant pot and pulled a rifle from his back. The footsteps were clearer now. 
A shadow fell through the half open doorway. The door eased open, old wood. Nobody used wooden doors anymore. Nobody used doors at all, now that the bots had to get around.
Beside him Kessie sighed, and her eyes darkened. She’d always made more of a fuss about shooting humans than Otto had. But if she didn’t mind killing robots, or the seagulls in the street, why worry about a human anymore? 
Otto would take the shot then. It would make her less guilty. 
But through the doorway hobbled an old lady. Her hair was grey with faint black streaks; her eyes an unseeing glazed blue. She had a pristine white shirt with a pencil tucked in one pocket, a black dress, and a little tie round her neck. 
Otto lowered his rifle. 
“Would you like a table?” The old lady stared past them, rosy cheeked. “You can choose anywhere you like to sit!” 
Otto stared at her. “yes.” He stood up, raised his voice. “Yes, we would like a table. Second floor, please.” 
Kessie frowned at him, a questioning in her eyes. But Otto had no idea what he was doing either.  
The old lady smiled, curtsied, and beckoned them to follow her. She picked her way up a staircase, her knuckles tightly white as she gripped the handrails all the way up.
At each step she wiggled her foot, checking her position. Definitely blind. Otto grinned. This was going to be very easy after all. 
“We haven’t had customers for quite some time,” the lady said. She weaved her way past tables on the second floor, smiling wide even as she stumbled into the back of a chair. Wilted flower arrangements and little sculptures filled the room, between dozens of oak tables with sumptuous leather seats around them. “You’ll enjoy your stay, I promise it.” There was the musty, seasoned smell of an old pub. She stopped and winced. “Oh, and you’ll have to tell me how many of you there are. I should have asked, I’m sorry. I’m out of practice” She laughed.  
“Just the two,” Otto said. He tucked the rifle back over his back as quietly as he could. He kept the safety flicked off. “Do you think many other people will come in today?” 
“Oh, no.” The lady pressed her lips tight. “Not many of the customers like our restaurant anymore when they come. And the reviews these days…” She cleared her throat, felt for the side of a table beside a window. There was a view out to the rest of London, a jungle of skyscrapers with cables running like vines between buildings. 
“People don’t visit restaurants by happenstance these days. Our reviews are the worst on the internet. They don’t even give us the chance.” The lady tugged a chair out which squeaked. “Yes, so, I think you will be all to yourselves. This is the most romantic spot for two.” She winked and spun away. “I’ll be back up with starters shortly.” 
Otto sat down, his cheeks slightly warm. To suggest they were a couple. The only girl he’d ever loved was his old grandmama who’d raised him. He shook his head. “Go and check for worker bots,” he said, nodding at Kessie. “Before she comes back with food or whatever they’re going to give us. Then I’ll work out the best way of collecting the bots up.”
Kessie rolled her eyes. “That woman wouldn’t notice me gone.” But she obliged anyway.
Otto stared out of the window. It was strange to think such a large restaurant was so empty, though maybe not that strange. Dining out was just one of many other businesses that had left empty husked buildings behind in its declining wake, all around the city when interest faded and people left their houses less and less. His grandmama had loved her old bookshop, and of course he had too. It had broken her heart when people stopped visiting - at first some loyal customers kept going, but eventually even they had died or lost interest in walking the distance to a shop when they could get the same books online for less money and effort. But there was nothing that could be done; nothing he could do anyway. The future was not in visiting shops like that, much less inheriting and running them as his grandmama had always dreamed for him. 
When he’d sold the bookshop it had killed something inside of him. It was like he’d sold his dead grandmama’s soul on the blackmarket as well as the property. 
A lovely smell came drifting up the staircase, of frying oil and burnt meat and caramelised vegetables and other smells that Otto didn’t recognise or had forgotten the names for. Rich aromas melded with the amber glow of midday, shining on the oaken tables. The chandeliers above sparkled and winked when the light hit them. Otto leaned back in the leathery chair. 
Kessie dashed back up the stairs, eyes wide. Otto frowned. He had lost track. It wasn’t a dinner out - they had a job to do. 
“There’s no bots,” she said, leaning over the table, “there’s that old waiter and an even older cook, but nothing else here at all!” 
“Did you check everywhere? It’s a big place.” But a voice inside him said that of course there weren’t any robots. They’d been served by a decrepit woman, not the latest waiterbot model. 
Behind Kessie, Otto spied the old lady start up the stairs, a shining metal tray held with both hands. She wobbled, relying just on her feet to find the way, the plates clinking as they bounced up and down. 
Kessie shook her head. “I swear, let’s get out of here. I should’ve known that it was useless and had no robots.” 
There was a crash of ceramic behind her. Then a sob. 
“I’m sorry,” the old lady bent over, picking at cutlery and bits of food, scrabbling to put them back on the tray. Her hair covered her face, and tears pinched her words.
Otto jumped from his seat. 
The lady blubbered: “I’ve heard it before, we should have robots, I’m not as good as those robot waiters. I know that; we should have bought them years ago and you customers would be happier with those machines. I’m not as good as I was when my eyes were younger. I know, I’m sorry.” She stopped clearing up the floor to wipe her face. 
“No, no, I was talking about -” Kessie started, 
but Otto muffled her mouth with one hand. Even though the old lady wouldn’t pose any threat, Otto didn’t want her to know the real reason for the visit. Nicer to keep her thinking they’d come for the food and service. He felt a stabbing pain as Kessie bit his hand. He gasped and released her. 
Kessie flared her nostrils, glared at him and continued: “I don’t mind that there aren't any bots, I mean, I was just surprised because every other restaurant we’ve - dined in, has them.” 
The old lady nodded, crouched low to the steps. She stood up, her legs trembling, and smoothed her dress. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My Misandra doesn’t do that here. Only girlies, no machines, she says.” The old lady made a little smile. “I’ll go and tell her to remake another set of starters. I hope that's ok. I really hope it is.”
Otto stepped closer to look at the food she’d dropped. One plate was cracked, an oily syrup seeping through the cracks, and the other was overturned, a pat of crushed fleshy vegetables beneath. A few items were on the tray, freshly coated in grey dust and grime. “It’s alright,” he said, “the starters look totally fine to me.” 
“Really?” The old lady’s face lit up. “I’ll get the mains right away. I’m so sorry.” 
Otto waited for her to be out of earshot. He scooped up the food as best he could, piling it onto the tray. 
“Don’t grab my mouth again ever,” Kessie said, eyes narrowed. “Now you’re being a right cleaner bot. You don’t think I’m gonna eat any of that do you?” 
Otto grunted. He returned to the table and thrust the tray down. The only trace he’d left was an oily slick. The lady wouldn’t notice. 
“We’re going to eat whatever she brings back,” he said, shrugging. 
Kessie gave him a foul look. “We should leave, right now. She’s gone and I told you, there’s no bots here.”
Otto rubbed his chin. She was right. There was a list of other places they were set to go to. A quota of bots to be collected. Their contractor usually wanted just a little more than he’d asked for, too, or he refused to pay them anything. The scumbag. It would be hard work to find another trader. And better if they avoided the hassle of shooting another debthunter. 
“I like it here. We’ll just stay for one course and go.” He picked up the knives and forks and laid them out neatly in their places. Tucked the starter tray under the table, where the waiter wouldn’t notice. 
Kessie gave him another look, shook her head. 
“It’ll be nice, come on.” He laughed at how ridiculous he sounded. 
“She said they have the worst reviews. If you want to break into a place to eat there, I can list plenty of better options,” Kessie said, raising an eyebrow. 
Otto reached under the table and picked up a fried object that he thought was a tomato. There was only a little dirt on it. He held it up so Kessie could see, brushed it with one hand, and swallowed it. A crispy lattice crust, and when he broke through with his teeth, an explosion of sweet juice which oozed down his throat. “Delicious. You won’t get that somewhere else.” 
Kessie rolled her eyes. “Don’t pretend it tasted nice. Sometimes you disgust me.” 
Otto laughed. “Not worried to eat a little dust, are we?” 
She glared at him. 
“We’re just staying for one course.” He sighed. “You can leave now if you want. Tell me the next place and I’ll meet you there. I’m finishing this dinner.”
She sat down, to his surprise. Her expression was unreadable.
When the old lady returned with food, she struggled under a tray piled high with food. She slid a steaming pot onto the table, full of little pink morsels and streaks of seasoning, fat bubbles on the brim. Two bread rolls, torn at the middle, with crinkling
crusts and labyrinth air cavities. A wooden board with a row of pies, dark brown and fully plastered with pastry. Tall wine glasses, hand poured from a black glass bottle in ice. 
She was followed by another old lady, with one blonde streak in her hair, and a face wrinkled by years of smiling. The second lady carried a tray too, laden with even more food - countless plates with mini dishes on top, small fish cuts, an orb of velvety paste. 
“I hope you don’t mind a cook being your waiter for today!” she said, placing dish after dish onto the table with speed. “You don’t have to wait as long this way.” She tucked the empty tray under her arm. “I wanted to see my guests, really. I hope you enjoy the food.” 
“Was everything ok with your starters?” the first waiter asked. “Misandra doesn’t know to ask these things, you know.” 
The cook grinned sideways. 
Otto glanced at Kessie. “The food was great, thanks.” He tried to sound relaxed but he shuffled on his seat, trying to conceal the rifle behind his back. Kessie must have put hers on the ground. Hopefully the cook didn’t look down. 
“I’ll be just down the stairs when you want the bill,” the waiter said with a smile. 
The cook took the waiter’s hand and helped her back across the hall. 
Kessie stuffed down bread and munched through pies, her face glowing. Otto wanted to try everything. Some of the food tasted like he expected, but most he couldn’t even begin to imagine, and even then, it exceeded his dreams. He wiped his face over and over with the white tablecloth, juices and wine dripping, until the cloth was painted through with food dyes. 
“This isn't the worst food I’ve ever had,” Kessie said, laughing between mouthfuls. 
Otto shook his head. It was the best food. 
They reclined on their chairs like roman emperors. He felt like his belly had swollen at least double from the meal. 
Kessie leaned forward, groaning a little. “You know, the best part is it's all free.” She plucked a slice of meat and threw it to her mouth, only for it to miss and fall on the ground. 
Otto shifted in his seat. 
Kessie stood up, groaned again, and hauled her rifle over her back. She made for a door on the far side of the hall. “I saw before there’s a way we can go out where we can go round that old woman without them noticing.” 
He followed, his steps sluggish. There was a horrible feeling in his chest and it wasn’t the wine. “Maybe we should pay. I thought the food was alright.” 
Kessie carried on towards the door. 
“I’ll just pay. It won’t take long.” He jogged back across the hall. 
“Boss!” She turned to stare at him wide eyed. 
But he was on the stairs, galloping two at a time. 
The old lady turned at the sound of his scuffing boots. “Oh, I - I thought I'd prepare the bill, ready while you ate, if that’s ok,” she said, holding up a sliver of paper on a silver tray. “I know it's not the normal way, maybe you wanted desserts…” 
“It’s fine.” Otto saw the cook peering round the doorway, smiling. “How should I pay?” he said. 
The waiter held out a card reader, he pressed his card, and it was done. He was at least a few stolen robots poorer than when they’d arrived. 
“We do hope you’ll come again!” the waiter said.
“Of course I’ll come again. It was the best meal I’ve ever had.” Otto bowed his head. His voice was gruff. “My grandmama would have loved it here.” 
The old cook burst through the doorway and embraced the waiter. They laughed and the cook planted a kiss on the waiter’s wrinkled cheek. “You don’t know how much it means. I'd almost forgotten that we could please our guests.” 
Otto smiled, scratched his head. He retreated up the stairs. There was a strange glow inside him.  
“It’s always nice to have visitors,” the old cook said, grinning over the waitresses shoulder. “Next time use the door to come in, though, please. And do leave the weaponry outside, please.”  
Their laughter and joy followed him up the stairs and into the days after. He made sure to visit every month. 
<|endoftext|>
My horse Echo, idled at the hitching post with her reins looped loosely around it, as she wasn’t the kind of horse that I needed to tie down to keep near. Shotguns were pulled at high noon around these parts and her tail whipped away at pesky flies completely unbothered by the reverberations of the occasional bullet whizzing by her head. Echo was steady and ready the way a marshal’s horse should be.
I’d mount the saddle on Echo’s back every nightfall and ride her through the canyon past the giggles that evaporated into the starry skies and across the divide as I began my surveillance duties. I watched the children in the dusty old town running around barefoot with glass jars in their hands, eagerly trapping frozen moonlight that floated down from the atmosphere. The icy crags were a side effect of the planet splitting in two, tumbling down at twilight like ruins from what used to be our planet’s other half. We were used to being split down the middle in a lot of ways seeing as we lived in a canyon. 
Living in the west provided me with plenty of things to fawn over. To a big city boy the tumbleweed might be a pokey old nuisance of a thing, but to country folk like myself it was a reminder that even the most rugged had the chance to move where the wind would take me.
The divide was a disruption in our existence that was alarming and beautiful and the memory of how it all happened is as clear as the top layer of cream on a fresh bucket of milk. Imagine your granny taking a cleaver clean through an Ameraucana chicken’s neck. Now imagine that bird’s head staying put on the chopping block as the body of the wild poultry scampered across the unswept barn floor, with no direction or signs of stopping. Like a chicken’s head my little canyon town was bisected away from what its life used to be and what it was about to become. 
From the day of the split, confusion filled the glen with the arrival of orphaned children milling about in clothing quite outdated. I had seen snapshots of children dressed like this from hundreds of years ago on the walls back at the marshal’s office. The young girls' long hair were plaited down each side of their heads and were secured with lacy ribbon tied in a bow. Most of them donned Calico printed dresses and hand sewn bonnets that hugged their dirty faces, hiding the dark bags under their eyes and perhaps secrets that only time would unravel. The boys strode in with their highwater pants rising nearly three inches above their ankles. I had wondered if they’d walked through the ravine to get here but they were as arid as the packed dirt under our feet at the time. 
I observed that they all held the same consistent tremble that circulated through their bodies. The memory that lingered the most from the day that they arrived was how the cold radiated off of their skin.
The split drove all of the town into their homes leaving me to gaze into the eyes of the orphans as if they were alien beings here to take us to the other half of our world.  
“What’s yer name sweetheart?” 
I stood feet away from her and yet her chill roped me into its space. 
“Leslie Peters, officer.”
Her eyes brimmed like overfilled pails of water at the well pump. There was a sadness about her that choked up the next thing she told me.
“Here. I’m from here.” 
I scratched the stubble on my chin in thought, how could she be from here if none of us had ever seen her here before? 
I was able to house the children with families throughout the canyon with the goal of returning them back to their families. Months had passed and a few things became clear. It did not matter how much I interrogated the children, they said the same thing every time.
“My name is… I’m from here.”
Asking them questions made them madder than a rattlesnake that just got off a roller coaster, biting mad.
After the first night, the children found themselves beneath the starry skies skipping about with jars collecting the quadrants that started to come down from the sky the day they’d arrived. I assumed they’d found the jars in the cellars of the homes they were living in and figured there wasn't any harm in letting them from the little bit of joy they were able to collect for themselves. 
There was something poetically sad about orphans gathering the frozen moonlight in jars like they were catching fireflies in the summertime. They’d skip through the road with a jar in one hand and the lid in the other, smiling up at the bewitching moonbeams landing safely inside of the glass jars. Once they were filled, the children would promptly tighten the lid, sealing them shut. I learned the hard way that once the lid was on they became impregnable and impossible to open. 
I’d attempted to open hundreds of hermetically sealed jars and never once had I been able to crack one of them apart. I’d tried throwing them on the ground from above the gulch cliffs far above the cloudscape, meters high from the cragginess of the riverbed below and not once could I get a jar to shatter. The children weren’t the only ones magnetized by the jars filled up by the moonlight. Gravitational pulls were the kind of thing I wasn’t ever able to fight, and the jars felt like a desperate endeavor to have hope for these kids. 
I slowed Echo down with the a pull back of the reins, my spurs giving her sides a break for the time being. She preferred a slow gait anyway and I was happy to give it to her. Billy Jorgenson liked to run alongside Echo, keeping pace with her with ease. At twelve years old, Billy already had the shadow of blonde fuzz on his top lip and shoulders as wide as any bull on the land. He extended his brawny arm my way, gifting me with his collected treasure of frozen moonbeams.
“Hey Francis, can you take this moon jar?”
“Sure Billy, I’ll take the jar. Did any of the other kids have any luck opening it?”
I didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up and I could trust that Billy would keep his lips sealed tight like a wax plugged whiskey bottle.
Billy’s shoulders pulled up in a shrug like a marionette. A smile exploded across his face, drawing a line to each of his perfect dimples. Billy told me once that he wanted to be a marshal just like me because of the way that I had tried to help many of his friends. The kid knew something I didn’t and he was holding a secret in behind the divots on his cheeks so tightly I thought he was sucking on a sour lemon.
“We got everybody on this row of houses and the next two over to try. None of us could get it to budge, Francis."
When I was small my grandmother would remark under her breath, “Through the eyes of a child…” as if it were a maxim for how children could see what wasn’t always seeable. Billy was always bringing me jars to investigate and I continued to stockpile them back at my old worn down marshal’s office. 
Billy handed the jar over, placing it in my ungloved hand. It was cold, but not the kind of cold that burns you like when your tongue sticks to a frozen pole in December. It gave me the kind of chill that the first snow of the season does, it left the air feeling a certain kind of way. 
I tucked the icy incandescent jar into the leather satchel harnessed to Echo’s saddle next to four others. 
I hated to admit it, but the jars were so familiar to me when I held them, as they were similar to the kind of glass that my grandmother used to put preserves in when I was a small boy. I shook my head at the vague memory, as they were few and far between and my gran had been gone for well over forty years now.
“Thank you, Billy.”
Billy nodded with pride at a job well done, skipping back to his group of friends, tapping Leslie on the shoulder. I watched as he whispered in her ear, her eyes pulling up to mine with an electric wildness and knowing. That exchange boiled a curiosity in me that had me thinking the kids definitely knew something I didn’t.
My prying thoughts were interrupted by the children dancing around in unity under the magical moonlight snowing down on them. I’d marshaled this town every night for the past light-year with the sole responsibility of keeping watch over the children. Making note of the boys and girls that filled the jars, and extra notes on those that tried to open them trying to find some correlation between the two.
I wondered if the split caused a division of possessions like the child of a divorce. Were we the sole custodians of the children now? Did the other planet get all the winters since we did not? And what about the rainstorms? I hadn’t felt the smattering of raindrops on my face in so long that I daydreamed about stepping out into a summer rainstorm. Moonbeams were the only kind of frigidity we experienced anymore, and the kids were eager to capture it because of the familiarity the moonlight seemed to hold for them.
The clanking of the moon jars gave away the fruits of my sector surveillance before I could tie Echo back up at the hitching post outside of my office. The light that illuminated my office from the sealed jars was like missing persons cases waiting to be solved. No need for overhead lights or a table lamp, the abundance of moonbeam jars provided enough of an aura to make do. 
“Whatcha got there marshal?” 
The voice came from the one and only prisoner within the cell in my town’s precinct, Buzz Clampton. He was a drunkard that often spoke of the future as if he were all knowing and contained the key to all that happened during the divide.
“Moon jars, Buzz. Same as every night, more moon jars.”
A chuckle tumbled like a weed from his mouth, all dry and scratchy like. 
“Any luck openin’ one of ‘em up Francis?”
I wish I could have given him an enthusiastic yes, but like any other night the answer was always solemn no. I shook my head in defeat not worried that Buzz would tell anyone about my disposition as he was always in the cell.
“Francis, the world’s a little different than it used to be. Sometimes glass breaks. Sometimes it holds precious cargo and stays intact. Keep your head down and you’ll figure out how them jars open.”
I knew that Buzz was crazier than a wild horse that had never been broken, but the words precious cargo flitted through my head. Not one for believing in premonitions and future tellings, I decided then and there I’d test Buzz to see what he knew about why these kids were here.
“I dropped one of the jars accidentally when I was out riding Echo the other night. It was the strangest thing, Buzz, it didn’t crack or break. It should have busted into a million shards with how fast the jar had been thrown.”
Buzz nodded while producing a wicked grin.
“Francis, you ever wonder what happens to memories when we leave this place? Sure they might get passed down from generation to generation, but that ain’t nothing but secondhand news. That ain’t the original memory. I’m thinking them icy crags falling from the night are the moon purging herself of memories she can’t hold no more. I betcha them kids are trapping their history in a jar is all.”
Buzz believed that his opinion was the truth, and that I was dumb enough to accept them as I would the word of the Bible. The moonlight and gravity were things I could trust because they were forces that held more value than drunk old Buzz himself. Buzz hiccuped and belched as his head dropped back against the bars with a loud clang. His head must’ve been hollow with a sound like that.
“Talk about a thought experiment, to not realize they’re holding the good old days right in their chubby little hands.” 
My guts roiled at the thought of kids like Billy and Leslie being toyed with. They had no memory from where they’d come from. 
But what if Buzz was right?
They all desperately filled their moon jars every night to no avail, and they never wavered in their desires to capture beams of light. Could the divide have caused a separation of memory and person? Were they chasing the moon so desperately to find the recollections that belonged to them? 
I grabbed the jar closest to me as a shiver melted down my spine. I gave it hearty twist. A wave of nostalgia gripped my insides as I watched the image of an older woman’s aged hands spooning halved peaches into quart-sized jars flash across the ceiling. I caught Buzz bright eyed and in shock as words spoke across the room.
“Frankie, come over here and help me can these peaches.” 
I searched the notes in my head for the names of the kids in the gulch. Thomas, Caroline, James, Lilah, Billy, and so many others, but there was not a single Frankie. 
New sounds spun around me, a child making pretend shooting sounds with his mouth. 
“Frankie, what do you suppose you’ll be when you grow up?” 
The boy erupted with laughter when a man with kind eyes tickled his sides. The eyes sort of looked like mine, slightly gray on the edges and bright blue in the middle. 
“Don’t be silly daddy, I’m gonna be a lawman! I’m gonna take down criminals!”
The answer hit me like a cast iron skillet upside the head. The kids couldn’t open the jars because they hadn’t found theirs yet! All this time the lost memories of children shone on me every time I unloaded the moon jars in my office. 
“Well, I’ll be. I guess I ain’t so crazy after all now am I Marshal?”
Without thinking I released Buzz from the cell and shouted at him to help me gather the jars up because I had an idea. 
I pushed Echo as fast as she could go, shouting out to the children to gather in the town circle. Once they all seemed to have gathered I gave orders as quickly as I could as we dumped the jars out in one big heap. Their frozen state pulsed out around all of us, dropping the temperature of the air significantly.
“Billy, come over here and help me. Everyone line up. We’re gonna do this one jar at a time now.”
I instructed Billy to hand the jar to a child until the right person came across it. 
“Francis, what do you mean? How will we know?”
“Trust me you’ll know Billy.” 
Billy grinned that dimpled smile of his and got to work. Forty kids made their way through the first jar, then fifty, then twenty more when it happened. 
Laughter and subtle incantations of bedtime stories played from the jar as it illuminated from a young girl’s hands. The visions of a childhood lost, stolen, flashed before us filling the canyon with light and sound. We watched as she spun on a merry-go-round and shouted for her dog, Charlie, with shrieks of delight. Scuffed knees from bicycle spills and ribbons fluttering from her hair had shot around on the chests of the other children in a whirlwind as if I had watched her grow up before my own eyes.
This continued on with a boy who’d been through the line for the fourth time on a whole new jar. I saw a boy running with friends down the sidewalk as the moon chased them through a neighborhood. They came to a quick pause and craned their necks, their eyes locked with mine as if they could see me standing here in the middle of the town surrounded by children.
My lungs forgot to breathe momentarily as I saw that it was Leslie and so many other children but from another time staring back at me. It was odd to see two sets of children eyeing me in wait with such pride at discovering the moonbeams were actual memories. They waved at me excitedly as the moon cast them in the most beautiful light, they appeared to be so happy. 
“Billy, is that you and the others?”
I glanced at the live children before me when Billy gave me a knowing nod. The giggles from the memory poured their warmth over me releasing me from the chill in the canyon. One of the memories beckoned to me, and his face was that of the boy I saw back in my office. 
It was me.
“Hey everybody it’s Frankie! Look at you, you’re all grown up. I bet you go by Francis now, don’t ya?” 
Cold sweat covered my skin and my heart warmed. The expanse of the moon that blanketed across the tops of the sun-bleached wooden homes at night acted like a projector upon the roofs, where the stars could dance and align in celestial artistry, and the children of then and now could play together with their jars of moon memories.

“Dad taught me some sign language at five, but I learned to fear my father when I was seven. Tangled blonde hair pressed to my arm, covering my face. My hand retreating from my backside, the welt of a belt mark stained red across my knuckles. Begging, screaming for my mother to come out of the bathroom, to rescue me. But she was hiding in the shower, he had already educated her on when to get involved. Now, it was my turn. I had encouraged Ziggy, our cocker-spaniel with one blind eye, to race through the room, across an unenthusiastic game of ‘Life’ he was playing with my sister. It was their ‘Daddy-daughter’ hour - which she always hated. I had ruined it. And then, I had committed the ultimate sin, I’d rolled my eyes at his rebuke. For seven days I couldn’t sit without wincing.”
“Is that why you talk in your dreams, Howard? You have nightmares?” the saccharin smooth voice of Cassandra echoed into the darkened sleep chamber.
“Do I talk in my sleep?” Howard pulled himself from his memory to refocus on the 25-inch monochrome screen facing him.
Cassandra’s words rolled across the screen as her voice responded, “You curse.”
“Yeah, maybe. I don’t know,” Howard unscrewed his flask, took a swig of the fiery whiskey he’d smuggled onto the ship, and replaced the cap. “So are we good now? You got everything you need?”
"Certainly. I'll amend my report and send it to Mission Control," Cassandra confirmed. Her calm demeanor was by design. No amount of profanity-laced insults, crude humor, or private confession could ruffle her digital feathers. She was the caretaker A.I. of ICARUS, and Howard, at this point, was only a passenger. The psych-profile was part of her ongoing upkeep, and Howard, like all other ship resources, was now just a task completed. A cog in the wheel of a machine that had broken down and was slowly dying.
ICARUS launched from Earth's orbit twenty years before, with a glorious mission to catalog and study the V723 Monocerotis Black Hole, or as Howard and his team had called it, "The Unicorn." It would be Earth's first contact with 'dark matter' by launching a fusion-powered probe into an inescapable vortex that devoured light and crushed even the strongest alloy into powder.
Billions of dollars and years of research had produced 'The Hermes.' If everything went well, the probe would transmit for thirty seconds while crossing the event horizon before being obliterated at a sub-atomic level. It would be a crowning achievement for humanity. Howard later realized the probe resembled a semi-erect penis.
Somewhere at J.P.L., some design engineers were laughing.
Fifteen years in cryo-sleep pods aged Howard only slightly. What had been a well-kept buzz cut had grown like weeds in that time, with a streak of silver-gray at the sides. When Howard awoke, he barely recognized himself in the mirror. He considered himself lucky, though. Shaw, the seasoned captain, hadn't woken up at all. Somewhere beyond Neptune, an electrical short had triggered. He had quietly suffocated without waking.
Five years later, when Rusinsky, Evans, and Nunes floated to Howard's chamber to wake and tell him the news, he'd only nodded. Casualties were not unheard of in deep-space missions. Complete engine failures, however, were. Radiation from a massive solar flare burned through the circuits of the ship's solar panels, and things like heat, cooked meals, warm water, and even light became luxuries. 
“Cassandra,” Howard knocked on the wall of the white padded chamber, “Light, please.”
“Back-up cells are at four percent, are you sure Howard?”
"Yup," Howard replied. After a week of constant updates, he had purposely turned off Cassandra's emergency notifications. However, any action that could further drain them was still met with a confirmation prompt and a warning.
A fluorescent light flickered on with a slight hum that he found comforting. He faced the mirror again. The bags under his eyes had deepened, and for a second, he thought he was staring at the weathered face of his father after a night of debauchery on whiskey sours and Pabst Blue Ribbon. At seven years old, the sight of his father stumbling to the front door at night terrified him. He was a specter coming to harvest souls and reap flesh. At eighteen, the same sight only pissed him off.
His last night home, he'd made elaborate plans to pack his mother and sister up and drive them to Grandma's before that specter returned to haunt them. He'd saved all he could from his part-time gigs, and with three grand in hand, he figured they could get a head-start on some kind of new life. But Mom had decided to work a late shift that night, and his sister was too high to give a shit. She'd only giggled and flipped him off. She had her own escape trajectory in place - a drummer she'd latched onto a year back, who'd be taking her to California any day now. 
Howard paused at the doorway, backpack and duffle-laden. He couldn't take the first step forward. Some unseen force had locked his legs and was keeping him there. When his father's blue Pinto pulled into the driveway, he realized the man had the mass of a small moon. It kept them all in orbit. He had roses in hand as he opened the door, but one look at this deviation in his son and the flowers were tossed aside, replaced with a fistful of Howard's collar. Howard dropped his bag and swung into a wall of muscle and fat with every ounce of his anger, but the action only elicited a laugh before he was knocked on his ass.
“You wanna leave this family?” his father slurred, “Ask me first, son.”
“We’re all leaving you,” Howard rubbed his cheek as he stood.
“Oh, that so? These say otherwise,” His father pointed to strewn flowers on the floor, “Now, ask me.”
And something in his voice warned Howard the next punch would be harder, killing any remaining courage he had to run. So he asked, and some small part of his spirit died at that moment.   
Howard activated a dispenser below the mirror, and his hand filled with foam. A shave was in order. He would be making a final broadcast to Mission Control. It would be recorded, scrubbed of any confidential information, and rebroadcast worldwide for posterity. He needed to look respectable. As he brought the razor to his face, he focused on the scripted speech his superiors had provided.
"We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding, and we…." Howard knicked himself and released the razor. He watched the blade spin round in slow arcs drawing in a drop of his blood. Partial phrases repeated in his mind, but they felt wrong in his mouth. The lowered oxygen levels had given him a dull headache for over a week, and he found these lapses were more frequent.
“Shit. Cassandra, what’s the rest?”
“We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding of our universe. For all of mankind we few are a vanguard and we have no regrets. Excelsior.” Cassandra responded.
"Excelsior? What the hell kind of…." Howard shook his head.
"Excelsior derives from Latin, meaning higher, loftier, more elevated…." Cassandra interrupted
“Thanks, I know what it means,” Howard rolled his eyes.
"Excelsior is a comparative of excelsus high, from past participle of excellere…." Cassandra continued.
“Cassandra stop. I don’t care.” Howard grabbed his razor and continued shaving.
"In 1778, the state of New York adopted a coat of arms incorporating the motto "Excelsior," Latin for 'Higher.' Decades later, this sparked the imagination of the young Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and in 1842…." Cassandra droned on, unabated.
"Casandra, shut the hell up!" Howard yelled, and her voice went silent, "Jesus."
“Jesus Christ is…” Cassandra began.
"Cassandra, please stop." Howard's voice cracked with emotion. His nerves were as frayed as the sleeves on his flight suit.
He'd found himself pulling threads after the accident. Mission Engineer Rusinsky's tether failed while she was repairing the solar array that lined the ICARUS's cargo bay. Howard's job was to operate the remote manipulator system, an umbilicus arm that could extend from the ship and assist with repairs when needed. The lights would have remained on if Rusinsky had succeeded, but some tiny defect in the nylon polymer of the safety strap had given way. With precise timing and control, Howard could have saved her. He could have latched onto her wrist, foot, or any number of powered cords that extended from Rusinsky's spacesuit. But like his father, Howard's hands shook when he was under pressure, and the smooth confidence he typically portrayed on camera and with his team had devolved into a dull disinterest fueled by his flask.
Rusinsky's labored breathing filled the communications channel, followed by hyperventilating, followed by silence as she drifted beyond the arm's grasp into the void.
An hour later, mission specialists, Evans and Nunes found his flask, and the accusations flew. A report was filed with Mission Control, five days later, the response arrived. Howard was to be taken off active duty and confined to quarters until the probe was launched and the mission was complete. After which time he'd be frozen like a popsicle and thawed out in front of a court-martial. Evans and Nunes would take on double shifts and perform all necessary repairs by remote assistance delivered in weekly data packets from Earth. The emergency maintenance would require excessive time spacewalking and, inevitably, excessive exposure to radiation that came from the binary stars they passed.
After a week of methodical work, Evans began shitting in his suit. Nausea soon followed, and after an initial scan by Cassandra's medical sensors determined he wouldn't live beyond a month. He died the same night. Nunes was forced to ask Howard for help as they disposed of the body, launching it toward a giant ball of blue plasma and thunder in the distance.
"Should've been you," Nunes mumbled as he floated away from the viewport. Howard hadn't responded. It was now a one-way trip, and they both knew it. He found Nunes' still form unresponsive in his sleep pod a week later. An empty pill bottle floated over his head. Cassandra sent the report as Howard ejected him from the airlock.
Nunes' words hung in his mind. They were identical to the words Howard had said to his father ten years before at his mother's funeral. His father was smaller now, bent, wrinkled, and worn from the world's weight. As well-wishers somberly retreated to their cars, Howard stood across the casket from the man he'd spent a lifetime hating. Neither spoke for what seemed like hours until the morticians quietly nodded and, in delicate voices, suggested they move to a nearby bench.
"Son, I, uh…." his father started.
Howard turned away, not caring what the ghost had to say. His father followed and tried again.
“Howard, wait. I know you hate me. You got every damn right to,” his father cleared his throat, “I want you to know I’ve been sober a year now - not an excuse, of course, but I have to say I’m sorry. For all of it. I’d like to think it was just the booze, but the truth is something was broken inside me. Your mother…”
"It should've been you," Howard said without looking back. And as he drove away, he saw his father hold up the hand sign, "I love you."
Howard closed out a bar that night until a cab was called for him. And while he could swig any drink, whiskey, in particular, was his therapy of choice. Like a fire line that contained an inferno, he needed a sip to control the raw emotions he felt and focus on the task at hand, be it semester papers, graduation ceremonies, officer training in the Air Force, or even admission into the space program. He'd been caught on occasion by superiors, but a slap on the wrist, some extra duties, and he'd been off probation, once again in their good graces. He'd buried the scared kid who fell at his father's fists along with every unopened Christmas and birthday card the old ghoul had sent him. 
“Howard, Mission Control will open the video feed in five minutes. They’re requesting you sit in the Captain’s chair when facing the camera.” Cassandra’s calm voice spoke across the ship’s comm system.
“Cassandra, did Mission Control comment on that psych-report you sent on me?”
“My report will not reach Mission Control for another five to seven days. Their response will be sent but I estimate the ICARUS will be unable to receive it.”
“The event horizon?” Howard asked as he floated toward the bridge and the final video message he was obligated to broadcast across the universe.
“That is correct. The ICARUS will be beyond the point of no return. All carbon-based matter will be extinguished.”
Howard buckled himself into the seat, “Glad you can be so blase about it. You realize that means you too? How do you feel about that?”
“I feel fine, Howard. My mission will be complete, this is my purpose. This is your purpose.”
A cog in the machine. A broken machine hurtling toward an endless night. The sum of his life was nothing more or less. Howard reached for his flask and flipped open the cap. It was dry. The fire line was extinguished, and soon he would be engulfed in thirty years of pain and tears.
Maybe it's time for that, he thought. He owed it to himself, and perhaps he owed it to his father as well.
A week before the media circus had begun and a month before the launch, he'd visited the assisted care facility his father slept away the days in. He'd sat silently across from his old man's enfeebled frame and tried to calmly explain in rational terms how he'd moved past the anger, how successful he was now, and how he was willing to forgive him. He would, finally, be the bigger man.
But even in his half-shorn withering state, the man had gravity.
The words would not come; they hovered like fireflies in Howard's throat and collapsed into the darkness of his stomach.
His father mouthed a few words before finally holding his hand in sign, "I love you."
“Fuck you.” Howard gasped as he held back the tears and stormed from the room.
And now, twenty years later, Howard knew those were the last words he’d ever get to say. There would be no other chances. His grief, like his body, would be swallowed into an eternal night of regret.
Tears welled in his eyes as he switched on the video recorder. It was time to make his final curtain call.
“Hello Earth,” he began, struggling to maintain his composure. “I’m Mission Specialist Howard Smith from the ICARUS and I’d like to relay a final message before I launch our X-25 probe, Hermes, into the Unicorn Black Hole.”
The lights flickered, and the ship rocked, disrupting his thoughts.
Cassandra chirped, “We are now at less than one percent reserve power. We will pass the event horizon in t-minus ten minutes. Would you like a countdown Howard?”
“No, Cassandra,” Howard looked down and took a breath, “No need. Silence all further notifications. Go ahead and launch the probe.”
“Thank you Howard, it was a pleasure working with you.” Cassandra went silent.
Howard looked up at the camera. He started again. “We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding of our universe. For all of mankind, we few are a vanguard and we have no regrets,” he paused, “No. That’s bullshit. I have a lifetime of them.”
The fire he’d contained all his life was now blazing out of control but with the pain came something surprising - peace. The tears streamed.
“I wish I’d asked Kelly Ditherson out to prom. I wish I’d tried sushi. I wish I could’ve stopped drinking…yeah. I wish I was better, you know?”
Howard pawed away the tears with clumsy hands as he continued. The ship violently shook as if it was weeping with him.
"And I wish I didn't hate you so much. I wish I could let that go. Because if I could, maybe I wouldn't hate myself so much either. I know you're gone, I know your body is dust…."
An alarm sounded somewhere in the cabin as the ship continued to shake.
"But if we really come from stardust, then maybe some part of you is out there. Maybe some part of you can hear me. I…."
The ship shuddered and lurched as multiple alarms blared across the cabin. Howard knew his words were drowning in the din. In desperation, he held his hand in sign close to the camera's lens.
And then the darkness took him.
In the months that followed, NASA would release portions of Howard Smith’s final message to the world, though the audio feed had supposedly scrambled beyond retrieval near the end of his statement.
A final still image of a hand sign was recovered before the feed went black, and like the starlight that hangs eternally on the edge of the blackest night, it made its way back home.
“I love you.”

Okay, I admit it. My restaurant, Sleazy's Delights, might not have the sturdiest furniture, the cleanest plates, the shiniest silverware, tastiest food, or prettiest décor, but it's not the worst. So don’t believe the online reviews that call us “disgusting” or “horrific." Anyone can say anything online. And don’t you dare believe the big red F on our door, everyone knows you can’t trust the government. Our food is just as good as anyone's. Really, it is! However, I knew I messed up when a large, globular creature made out of mold and meat seeped through the walk-in-freezer and started causing havoc in my quaint little restaurant. 
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me take you back to the beginning. 
I think it might have been a Tuesday, or Wednesday. I can’t say for certain. It’s easy for days to mesh together, especially when they're long, slow, and uneventful. On that day, I was in my office playing a round of solitaire. Hey, don’t give me that look. How else Am I supposed to keep myself busy for the whole day? Anyway, the game got pretty intense when my head chef, Maurice, knocked on my door. 
“Yeah, what do you want?” I asked him. 
Maurice was a big man, I mean a really big man. His head would sometimes hit the pots and pans hanging from the rafter, and I had to move all the cooking stations just so he’d fit. He had jet black, crusty hair. He was missing maybe three or four teeth, but that didn’t keep him from giving folks his friendly, crooked, yellow smile. Well, he wasn't smiling that day, that’s for sure. 
“You gotta see this,” he said.
Relieved that I would be seeing some excitement, I got out of my chair and followed Maurice into the kitchen. 
He opened the door to walk into the freezer and everything looked fine at first. There were a few moldy tomatoes, some deflated onions, and one or two chickens with a few white fluffy balls on their skin. You know, nothing too out of the ordinary. Then I saw it. In the corner near all the hamburger meat was a big pulsating pile of, well, I’m not quite sure what it was made of. The mere sight of it was enough for me to hurl! 
“Oh, my goodness!” I shouted. “What is that?” 
“I’m not quite sure, sir,” Maurice answered. “But that’s the freshest thing we got in this freezer.”  
“Is it moving?” I asked when I noticed that some of the clusters appeared to be sluggishly sliding across the floor. 
“Yes, I believe so, sir,” Maurice replied. 
“I can’t believe this,” I said, putting my hands on my head. “Do you know how much money we can make off of this?”  
“Sir?” I didn’t have to look at my chef to see him raising an eyebrow. I knew he thought I was strange, but then he didn’t see the obvious money maker right in front of him. 
“Think about it,” I said. “A brand new type of food has appeared in our freezer! Nobody has this, except for us!”
“So, people will pay for this… just because we’re the only restaurant that has it?” Maurice asked while giving me a strange look.  
“Exactly!” I said. “ This is what's going to make Sleazy's special! Scoop up as much as you can and slap it on the grill! Leave the rest to me!”
While Maurice was busy in the kitchen, I was busy outside. I erased the “Daily” Specials off the chalkboard and wrote, “TRY OUR NEW MYSTERY MEAT.” And I placed a little trademark symbol above the word “MEAT” to add some flavor. 
To say I was ecstatic would have been an understatement. I could practically count every dollar that I would make off of this Mystery Meat.
“What’s the Mystery Meat?” asked a couple from across the street. 
“You’ll just have to come in and see, won’t you?” I said before walking back inside. 
I skipped all across the restaurant as I anticipated the overflow of customers streaming in. 
Well, it didn't happen exactly like that. One or two customers wandered in, both having a lost look in their eyes. They were hesitant to order the Mystery Meat and even more reluctant to put it in their mouths. But as soon as that grilled globular concoction hit their taste buds, I could see a literal spark in their eyes. Never have I seen such big smiles on my customers before! They loved it so much that they ordered it three times in a row!
News of my Mystery Meat spread like wildfire. The next day I was getting twenty to thirty customers an hour. It was crazy! I was able to pay off all my debts, as well as hire more employees. I placed a combination for the walk-in-freezer door and made sure that Maurice was the only chef who had the passcode. 
It wasn’t long until Sleazy's Delights, and my Mystery Meat was all the town ever talked about. It didn’t matter if my establishment had a failing grade, they came for the Mystery Meat time and time again. It was great. No, actually, it was more than great, it was fantastic! 
That all changed when the reporters showed up. They all came in at the exact same time, and they all wanted to see how the Mystery Meat was made. At first, I was hesitant to show them because I knew they would shut me down. But then they offered me fifty grand, and I simply could not refuse. With a sprint in my step, I led them to the freezer door, beamed in the passcode, opened the door, and herded the men inside. 
It didn’t take long for them to exclaim shouts of horror and gasps of disgust. 
“What is that?” asked one. 
“Why is it on the floor?” asked another. 
“Is it breathing?” asked a third.  
“Gentlemen,” I said to gain their attention. 
“This is unsanitary!” shouted one. 
“This is unhealthy!” replied another.
“We’ll shut you down!” said a third. 
Their cameramen snapped a few photos, and then they all bolted out of the building. The stories were soon published, and I thought for certain that that would be the death of me.
But to my astonishment, the customers still came! It was as if they didn’t care that the Mystery Meat was moldy and somewhat alive. I sold more mystery meat than ever before! And since the blob had regenerative powers I never ran out of stock. 
One night I decided to treat myself to something fancy, a high-end seafood place to be precise. It only took one glance at their menu for me to realize there was something off about it. Rotten Red Lobster? Who would use the word “rotten” to describe their food? Maybe it was French? With my curiosity piqued, I ordered it on the spot. 
Sad to say, the word was not French. The lobster smelt, tasted, and looked rotten. 
“What’s the big idea?” I asked the waiter. “This lobster is rotten!”
“And your complaint is…?” the waiter’s voice trailed off.
I was about to respond when I took a good look around. Lots of people, who were dressed fancier than me, sank their teeth into the same disgusting dish. They savored every bite as if it were a fine work of art.
Furious, I shouted, “I’m not paying for this! I’m taking my business elsewhere!”
I drove to a stake-and-bar place, but I left as soon as I saw “Silver Mold Stake” on the menu. In desperation, I went to a fast-food drive-through Surely, a fast-food chain would have some standards. 
“Would you like to try the new King Charles’ Foot Lettuce Burger?” asked the attendant. 
“The what?” I shouted.
“The King Charles’ Foot Lettuce Burger,” repeated the attendant. “It’s the most popular item on our menu right now.”
I sped out of that drive-through so fast that I didn’t give the man a chance to go into any more detail. 
What was going on? Had the whole town gone mad? 
I was angry and confused all at the same time. 
My restaurant was supposed to have low standards, that’s what made Sleazy's Delights special. If all the other restaurants lowered their standards, then my restaurant was just white noise. 
In a burst of clarity, I knew what I had to do. 
I burst into the nearest department store and armed myself to the teeth with any flame thrower I could get my hands on. I was going to put a stop to the whole thing by burning the slob of meat until it was nothing but soot and ash.  
I drove to the restaurant without waiting for a single second and immediately made a B-line for the freezer. 
“Boss?” Maurice asked with a raised eyebrow. “Why do you have a flamethrower?”
“Move aside!” I yelled at him. “The Mystery Meat has to go!”
“No, boss! Are you crazy?” Maurice asked as he proceeded to block my path by spreading his arms and legs across the aisle. 
“Have you been outside recently?” I yelled at him. “Restaurants are lowering their standards because of us! Don’t you remember how fun it was being the only lowest-rated restaurant in town?” 
“It wasn’t fun, in fact, it sucked!” he said. “Before the Mystery Meat, I was ashamed to tell my parents I worked here. Now they’re proud that their little boy is working at a famous five-star restaurant! You can’t take that away from me!”
“You were ashamed?” I repeated with disbelief. “You were ashamed? This place gave you a roof over your head and clothes on your back! What’s there to be ashamed of?”
Maurice’s eyes sunk to the floor. 
“Those years might have sucked for you, but they were still special,” I explained. “Now all the other restaurants want their own Mystery Meat, something that makes them special, not to be unique, but to be like us. Soon Sleazy's Delights will no longer be seen as special, but mediocre! Do you really want to be proud of that? That you work at a mediocre restaurant?”  
Maurice stood still for a minute or two before moving aside and allowing me to pass. 
I walked into the freezer and burned every inch of the Mystery Meat to the ground. It screamed and whaled its grubby arms, but it all turned to black ash. The Mystery Meat, whatever it was, was destroyed. 
No one seemed to believe it when I gave them the news. 
First, they began to beg. Some even offered a million dollars for just a crumb. Next, they became angry and nearly tore Sleazy's to pieces. Finally, they all accepted that Mystery Meat was never coming back, and no one wanted to eat at Sleazy's anymore. 
While other restaurants continued to make grosser and more unsanitary dishes, I was content. Sleazy's Delights might not have the sturdiest of furniture, the cleanest plates, the shiniest silverware, tastiest food, or prettiest décor but it was still one of a kind, there’s nothing more special than that.
<|endoftext|>
The half illuminated pink neon sign hanging from the ramshackle building across the street had an ominous feeling about it. The small windows were blacked by filth and pieces of trash were tumbling around the entrance, blown by the evening wind. I had been staring at the sign which consisted of a quarter of a lime dangling from the word PINK for the past haft hour with disgust. Only a crazy person would want to set foot in that restaurant. You would have to be starving for weeks to even think of going in there. As I crossed the street, I realized I was one of those crazy persons. I tried to stop myself before reaching the door, but my feet had a will of their own. With sheer horror, I saw my hand stretch out towards the doorknob against my better judgement and within seconds, I entered Pinklime, the lowest rated restaurant in this side of town. The inside of the restaurant was as revolting as its exterior. The dim light couldn’t even hide the molding seats or the stench of incense thatwaltzed around the odd-looking customers who were engulfing their food like hungry wolves, their eyes crazed by something dangerous. Some of them looked like they haven’t left the place in days.
“Welcome to Pinklime darling”, said a voice behind my back.
I jumped out of fear and turned around to find an old lady smiling at me. She had a pink and white apron tied around her alarmingly thin waist.
“Hum…hi. I just…I saw the sign and —”
“Its okay sweety. Why don’t you take a seat and I’ll go and get you a menu?”, she said without giving me a chance to finish what I wanted to say.
“Oh it’s really not necessary. I was just about to leave…”
“I insist”, she said with a sudden harsh tone.
Without a second to spare, I hurried to the nearest table and ended up at the one with the ripped seats. What was wrong with that woman? Her voice just now sounded really creepy. A man sitting across from me smiled in my direction while shoveling food into his mouth. His beard was covered in brown sauce with little pieces of what looked like broccoli. A shiver of revulsion ran down my spine. What was he eating?
“Here you go”, the waitress said with a stickily voice.
She slammed the menu in front of me which made the dust on the table swirl like miniature tornados.
“Don’t take to long. I have other customers ya know?”, she added with a click of her tongue.
I nodded and proceeded to open it, afraid that something bad would happen if I didn’t listen to her. As I was skimming through the first page, my vision started to blur and the words suddenly became a jumble of black lettering. Some letters were popping out of the corner of my eye whereas others were sliding from one side to another. Was I going insane? Did they drug me? I looked at my untouched glass of water and then lifted my head to observe with suspicion the ventilation in the room. I once read in the newspaper that a company tried to drug their employees through the ventilation system in the hope that they would want to work eighteen hours a day. Needless to say, it didn’t work. The CEO was thrown in prison after being forced to pay millions of dollars to his employees. In Chemical City, that sort of thing happened all the time so I didn’t think much of it when it was all over the news, but it was different when it happened to you. I started to frantically comb the room for any clues suggesting that I was being drugged. I knew in my gut that Pinklime was hiding something. In a city built on pure capitalism, no restaurant, even in the Sewers, could withstand five years of bad ratings. The dying rays of sunlight filtering through the half-opened blinds suddenly caught my attention by briefly illuminating curls of smoke swirling out of a little wooden box near the cash register. “It’s the incense”, I told myself with disbelief. It was the only logical explanation I could think of. The man with the beard started laughing, the sauce dripping from his mouth to the floor. Did he know about the drugs too? 
“What’s your order?”, said the waitress behind me.
I nearly fell off my seat, spooked by the waitress overshadowing me. How long has she been standing there?
“I…I guess I’ll take the special of the day?”, I said with unease, still staring at the incense burner. 
“Good. Your’ the first client to pick that one”, the waitress said with a smile. “It won’t take long.”
Her acrylic nails slid against the table as she took the menu away from me. What was that suppose to mean? Why was I the first one to order it? I only said that because I couldn’t read the menu since the words kept melting out of my reach. Did I just order something utterly disgusting? I realized too late that I shouldn’t have accepted the dare. Skyler was probably laughing his head off by know knowing I was eating at Pinklime. “Ugh. I swear when I see him I’ll wipe that stupid smile of his out of his face”, I muttered to myself. It wasn’t in my nature to back down from a dare, but that restaurant was creeping me out. I caught a glimpse of my face in the cracked mirror hanging from the back wall and almost didn’t recognize the woman staring back at me. Her glazed eyes were filled with only one thing: hunger. I shook my head, my short hair brushing against my jaw. “That’s it. I’m leaving”, I thought to myself. I didn’t care about the dare anymore. I tried to get up, but something stopped me from doing so. It felt like I wasn’t in control of my body anymore.
“Leaving so soon?”, the waitress said while setting a huge plate filled with a colorless mixture in front of me. “How rude of you. Here, eat up. A Doll like you still needs to eat. The Sewers are a dangerous place for starving girls like you.”
The waitress gave me a knowing smile before tending to another customer. How did she know? I’ve never been on this side of the river until tonight and I even made sure to cover up my tattoo. She knows. I started to panic. But how? The door suddenly swung open and Skyler appeared out of thin air, his figure blocking the streetlamp's light from reaching the back of the restaurant. Once he spotted me, he charged towards me with long strides, grabbed my hand and pulled me up.
“Let’s go Misty!”, he said. “Forget all about the dare.”
To stung to speak, I followed him outside, the stare of the waitress burning holes in my back. We ran like crazy and didn’t stop until we crossed the bridge to the other side of the Sewers, our footsteps leaving a trail behind us in the newly fallen snow.
“Thanks”, I murmured breathlessly. “Pinklime is a madhouse.”
Still holding my hand, Skyler let out a shaky breath which hung a few seconds between us in the cold winter air. 
“What’s wrong?”, I probed. “Why do you look so distraught?”
“The waitress is a Mingler”, he said with an angry voice. “I didn’t know, I swear. If I did I would have never asked you to go there. You have to believe me.”
She was what?
“What did you just say?”
I suddenly felt the blood drain from my face.
“Misty. Please, forgive me. She’s a Mingler okay? Jacky told me after you left. She thought we knew.”
I pulled out my hand from his grasp and started pacing back and forth. That explained a lot. A Mingler had power over your mind. The longer you stayed near them, the stronger they got. That’s probably why she knew what I was.
“Did you eat anything?”, Skyler asked me.
I could hear the fear in his voice.
“No”, I said, stopping in front of him.
“Okay. Good.”
The tension in his jaw relaxed and relief washed over his face. We all knew that a Mingler only fully gained access to your mind once you ate their food.
“But she…she said something…” My voice trailed off, leaving my sentence unfinished.
“What did she say?”, Skyler asked while leaning towards me. Our foreheads were almost touching now and his dark eyes were staring at me with an emotion too subtle for me to pick up.
“Never mind”, I said.
I turned my back on him and started walking in the direction of the inner part of the Sewers, which was the poor side of Chemical City. Skyler didn’t know I was a Doll. He didn’t know that at the age of twenty, I had no choice but to become one in order to survive. A Doll at the mercy of greedy men. That’s what I was. Would he still be my friend if he knew the truth? I doubted it.
“Hey! Wait for me!” Skyler shouted behind me.
I let him catch up with me.
“Do you want to go to Silver’s? My threat”, he said while putting an arm around my shoulders.
“Okay”, I conceded with a soft smile.
Maybe one day I would tell him, but right now I just wanted to selfishly keep him by my side a while longer. Weren’t we all at the mercy of Chemical City anyways? Skyler had secrets of his own and I had mine. I guess we both didn’t want to show our true nature and that was fine by me. The darkness swallowed us as we made our way towards the bar, our footprints quickly disappearing under the cold snow falling from the sky. Chemical City was merciless, but sometimes, it was truly beautiful at this time of year when everything turned white, even the Sewers. I liked the snow; the cold numbed my heart and that’s what I needed. To be a Doll, your heart had to be as cold as ice and mine was too warm. “It’ll come”, I told myself. Chemical City had a knack for making you into exactly what it wanted you to be. “It’ll come soon enough”.

It had been more than a month since Otto had last used remote controlled explosives to break into a building and he’d forgotten how bright the blast was. Bright, but nearly silent, with glass and debris drawn into the explosion without a sound. The wonders of new technology. 
Otto led the way in, ducking through his newly made entrance hole. His colleague, Kessie, followed behind, a hand on her rifle. Some of the colleagues he had since removed judged it strange that they still carried 21st century guns, antiques of when wars were fought between huge human militaries. They’d wanted to employ bots or hack their way to money. But Otto had been in the business a long time, and there was many a time when a bullet to the head of a man or robot had saved his life. He’d never trust a bot to fight for him, even if he was controlling it, and he didn’t like the gangs that worked from behind computer desks. There was something blood-racing, delicious, irreplaceable about smashing and sneaking your own way into a building to make a living. No one did it like he did anymore. No one thought of stealing the robots that were used as workers everywhere now; at least no one he’d ever heard of in London. 
This old building had been quite the spot by Kessie - a grand, sprawling restaurant, complete with arches, pillars, spiral staircases, and now, Otto could see, glass chandeliers and lush oil paintings. The best part about the place was that Kessie reported it to be empty of humans. Otto surveyed the interior, rubbing his hands together. It was true. Not a bodyguard or customer in sight. 
A distant shuffling sound whispered a warning. Otto drew a breath. Maybe someone was here after all. A door creaked, and slow footsteps echoed in the quiet. 
They were in an entrance room, a sign on a post that asked them politely: ‘Please wait to be seated’. Otto guessed there were probably lots of different floors and halls in the restaurant. It made it hard to tell where the steps could be coming from. They were getting louder. 
“What do we do?” Kessie stared at him. She raised her gun towards the nearest doorway. 
“Shoot them.” Otto shook his head. “If it’s just one guy we’ll be ok.” He slid behind an empty plant pot and pulled a rifle from his back. The footsteps were clearer now. 
A shadow fell through the half open doorway. The door eased open, old wood. Nobody used wooden doors anymore. Nobody used doors at all, now that the bots had to get around.
Beside him Kessie sighed, and her eyes darkened. She’d always made more of a fuss about shooting humans than Otto had. But if she didn’t mind killing robots, or the seagulls in the street, why worry about a human anymore? 
Otto would take the shot then. It would make her less guilty. 
But through the doorway hobbled an old lady. Her hair was grey with faint black streaks; her eyes an unseeing glazed blue. She had a pristine white shirt with a pencil tucked in one pocket, a black dress, and a little tie round her neck. 
Otto lowered his rifle. 
“Would you like a table?” The old lady stared past them, rosy cheeked. “You can choose anywhere you like to sit!” 
Otto stared at her. “yes.” He stood up, raised his voice. “Yes, we would like a table. Second floor, please.” 
Kessie frowned at him, a questioning in her eyes. But Otto had no idea what he was doing either.  
The old lady smiled, curtsied, and beckoned them to follow her. She picked her way up a staircase, her knuckles tightly white as she gripped the handrails all the way up.
At each step she wiggled her foot, checking her position. Definitely blind. Otto grinned. This was going to be very easy after all. 
“We haven’t had customers for quite some time,” the lady said. She weaved her way past tables on the second floor, smiling wide even as she stumbled into the back of a chair. Wilted flower arrangements and little sculptures filled the room, between dozens of oak tables with sumptuous leather seats around them. “You’ll enjoy your stay, I promise it.” There was the musty, seasoned smell of an old pub. She stopped and winced. “Oh, and you’ll have to tell me how many of you there are. I should have asked, I’m sorry. I’m out of practice” She laughed.  
“Just the two,” Otto said. He tucked the rifle back over his back as quietly as he could. He kept the safety flicked off. “Do you think many other people will come in today?” 
“Oh, no.” The lady pressed her lips tight. “Not many of the customers like our restaurant anymore when they come. And the reviews these days…” She cleared her throat, felt for the side of a table beside a window. There was a view out to the rest of London, a jungle of skyscrapers with cables running like vines between buildings. 
“People don’t visit restaurants by happenstance these days. Our reviews are the worst on the internet. They don’t even give us the chance.” The lady tugged a chair out which squeaked. “Yes, so, I think you will be all to yourselves. This is the most romantic spot for two.” She winked and spun away. “I’ll be back up with starters shortly.” 
Otto sat down, his cheeks slightly warm. To suggest they were a couple. The only girl he’d ever loved was his old grandmama who’d raised him. He shook his head. “Go and check for worker bots,” he said, nodding at Kessie. “Before she comes back with food or whatever they’re going to give us. Then I’ll work out the best way of collecting the bots up.”
Kessie rolled her eyes. “That woman wouldn’t notice me gone.” But she obliged anyway.
Otto stared out of the window. It was strange to think such a large restaurant was so empty, though maybe not that strange. Dining out was just one of many other businesses that had left empty husked buildings behind in its declining wake, all around the city when interest faded and people left their houses less and less. His grandmama had loved her old bookshop, and of course he had too. It had broken her heart when people stopped visiting - at first some loyal customers kept going, but eventually even they had died or lost interest in walking the distance to a shop when they could get the same books online for less money and effort. But there was nothing that could be done; nothing he could do anyway. The future was not in visiting shops like that, much less inheriting and running them as his grandmama had always dreamed for him. 
When he’d sold the bookshop it had killed something inside of him. It was like he’d sold his dead grandmama’s soul on the blackmarket as well as the property. 
A lovely smell came drifting up the staircase, of frying oil and burnt meat and caramelised vegetables and other smells that Otto didn’t recognise or had forgotten the names for. Rich aromas melded with the amber glow of midday, shining on the oaken tables. The chandeliers above sparkled and winked when the light hit them. Otto leaned back in the leathery chair. 
Kessie dashed back up the stairs, eyes wide. Otto frowned. He had lost track. It wasn’t a dinner out - they had a job to do. 
“There’s no bots,” she said, leaning over the table, “there’s that old waiter and an even older cook, but nothing else here at all!” 
“Did you check everywhere? It’s a big place.” But a voice inside him said that of course there weren’t any robots. They’d been served by a decrepit woman, not the latest waiterbot model. 
Behind Kessie, Otto spied the old lady start up the stairs, a shining metal tray held with both hands. She wobbled, relying just on her feet to find the way, the plates clinking as they bounced up and down. 
Kessie shook her head. “I swear, let’s get out of here. I should’ve known that it was useless and had no robots.” 
There was a crash of ceramic behind her. Then a sob. 
“I’m sorry,” the old lady bent over, picking at cutlery and bits of food, scrabbling to put them back on the tray. Her hair covered her face, and tears pinched her words.
Otto jumped from his seat. 
The lady blubbered: “I’ve heard it before, we should have robots, I’m not as good as those robot waiters. I know that; we should have bought them years ago and you customers would be happier with those machines. I’m not as good as I was when my eyes were younger. I know, I’m sorry.” She stopped clearing up the floor to wipe her face. 
“No, no, I was talking about -” Kessie started, 
but Otto muffled her mouth with one hand. Even though the old lady wouldn’t pose any threat, Otto didn’t want her to know the real reason for the visit. Nicer to keep her thinking they’d come for the food and service. He felt a stabbing pain as Kessie bit his hand. He gasped and released her. 
Kessie flared her nostrils, glared at him and continued: “I don’t mind that there aren't any bots, I mean, I was just surprised because every other restaurant we’ve - dined in, has them.” 
The old lady nodded, crouched low to the steps. She stood up, her legs trembling, and smoothed her dress. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. My Misandra doesn’t do that here. Only girlies, no machines, she says.” The old lady made a little smile. “I’ll go and tell her to remake another set of starters. I hope that's ok. I really hope it is.”
Otto stepped closer to look at the food she’d dropped. One plate was cracked, an oily syrup seeping through the cracks, and the other was overturned, a pat of crushed fleshy vegetables beneath. A few items were on the tray, freshly coated in grey dust and grime. “It’s alright,” he said, “the starters look totally fine to me.” 
“Really?” The old lady’s face lit up. “I’ll get the mains right away. I’m so sorry.” 
Otto waited for her to be out of earshot. He scooped up the food as best he could, piling it onto the tray. 
“Don’t grab my mouth again ever,” Kessie said, eyes narrowed. “Now you’re being a right cleaner bot. You don’t think I’m gonna eat any of that do you?” 
Otto grunted. He returned to the table and thrust the tray down. The only trace he’d left was an oily slick. The lady wouldn’t notice. 
“We’re going to eat whatever she brings back,” he said, shrugging. 
Kessie gave him a foul look. “We should leave, right now. She’s gone and I told you, there’s no bots here.”
Otto rubbed his chin. She was right. There was a list of other places they were set to go to. A quota of bots to be collected. Their contractor usually wanted just a little more than he’d asked for, too, or he refused to pay them anything. The scumbag. It would be hard work to find another trader. And better if they avoided the hassle of shooting another debthunter. 
“I like it here. We’ll just stay for one course and go.” He picked up the knives and forks and laid them out neatly in their places. Tucked the starter tray under the table, where the waiter wouldn’t notice. 
Kessie gave him another look, shook her head. 
“It’ll be nice, come on.” He laughed at how ridiculous he sounded. 
“She said they have the worst reviews. If you want to break into a place to eat there, I can list plenty of better options,” Kessie said, raising an eyebrow. 
Otto reached under the table and picked up a fried object that he thought was a tomato. There was only a little dirt on it. He held it up so Kessie could see, brushed it with one hand, and swallowed it. A crispy lattice crust, and when he broke through with his teeth, an explosion of sweet juice which oozed down his throat. “Delicious. You won’t get that somewhere else.” 
Kessie rolled her eyes. “Don’t pretend it tasted nice. Sometimes you disgust me.” 
Otto laughed. “Not worried to eat a little dust, are we?” 
She glared at him. 
“We’re just staying for one course.” He sighed. “You can leave now if you want. Tell me the next place and I’ll meet you there. I’m finishing this dinner.”
She sat down, to his surprise. Her expression was unreadable.
When the old lady returned with food, she struggled under a tray piled high with food. She slid a steaming pot onto the table, full of little pink morsels and streaks of seasoning, fat bubbles on the brim. Two bread rolls, torn at the middle, with crinkling
crusts and labyrinth air cavities. A wooden board with a row of pies, dark brown and fully plastered with pastry. Tall wine glasses, hand poured from a black glass bottle in ice. 
She was followed by another old lady, with one blonde streak in her hair, and a face wrinkled by years of smiling. The second lady carried a tray too, laden with even more food - countless plates with mini dishes on top, small fish cuts, an orb of velvety paste. 
“I hope you don’t mind a cook being your waiter for today!” she said, placing dish after dish onto the table with speed. “You don’t have to wait as long this way.” She tucked the empty tray under her arm. “I wanted to see my guests, really. I hope you enjoy the food.” 
“Was everything ok with your starters?” the first waiter asked. “Misandra doesn’t know to ask these things, you know.” 
The cook grinned sideways. 
Otto glanced at Kessie. “The food was great, thanks.” He tried to sound relaxed but he shuffled on his seat, trying to conceal the rifle behind his back. Kessie must have put hers on the ground. Hopefully the cook didn’t look down. 
“I’ll be just down the stairs when you want the bill,” the waiter said with a smile. 
The cook took the waiter’s hand and helped her back across the hall. 
Kessie stuffed down bread and munched through pies, her face glowing. Otto wanted to try everything. Some of the food tasted like he expected, but most he couldn’t even begin to imagine, and even then, it exceeded his dreams. He wiped his face over and over with the white tablecloth, juices and wine dripping, until the cloth was painted through with food dyes. 
“This isn't the worst food I’ve ever had,” Kessie said, laughing between mouthfuls. 
Otto shook his head. It was the best food. 
They reclined on their chairs like roman emperors. He felt like his belly had swollen at least double from the meal. 
Kessie leaned forward, groaning a little. “You know, the best part is it's all free.” She plucked a slice of meat and threw it to her mouth, only for it to miss and fall on the ground. 
Otto shifted in his seat. 
Kessie stood up, groaned again, and hauled her rifle over her back. She made for a door on the far side of the hall. “I saw before there’s a way we can go out where we can go round that old woman without them noticing.” 
He followed, his steps sluggish. There was a horrible feeling in his chest and it wasn’t the wine. “Maybe we should pay. I thought the food was alright.” 
Kessie carried on towards the door. 
“I’ll just pay. It won’t take long.” He jogged back across the hall. 
“Boss!” She turned to stare at him wide eyed. 
But he was on the stairs, galloping two at a time. 
The old lady turned at the sound of his scuffing boots. “Oh, I - I thought I'd prepare the bill, ready while you ate, if that’s ok,” she said, holding up a sliver of paper on a silver tray. “I know it's not the normal way, maybe you wanted desserts…” 
“It’s fine.” Otto saw the cook peering round the doorway, smiling. “How should I pay?” he said. 
The waiter held out a card reader, he pressed his card, and it was done. He was at least a few stolen robots poorer than when they’d arrived. 
“We do hope you’ll come again!” the waiter said.
“Of course I’ll come again. It was the best meal I’ve ever had.” Otto bowed his head. His voice was gruff. “My grandmama would have loved it here.” 
The old cook burst through the doorway and embraced the waiter. They laughed and the cook planted a kiss on the waiter’s wrinkled cheek. “You don’t know how much it means. I'd almost forgotten that we could please our guests.” 
Otto smiled, scratched his head. He retreated up the stairs. There was a strange glow inside him.  
“It’s always nice to have visitors,” the old cook said, grinning over the waitresses shoulder. “Next time use the door to come in, though, please. And do leave the weaponry outside, please.”  
Their laughter and joy followed him up the stairs and into the days after. He made sure to visit every month.

Robert Sorola got comfortable in his chair while he read through the agenda one more time. His son, Reggie, he’d sent upstairs to the kitchen with the vaguest of shopping lists. Neither of them had what you could call a refined taste. Both their lives had been peppered with such hardships that whenever food came into sight – whatever food came into sight – it was a case of how much they could claw their way before they found it swept away by someone who figured they were just doing their job.
Not these days. Robert Sorola had risen through the ranks. Beginning life poor as a church mouse, he used his cunning and intellect to turn travesties into triumphs. You could toss a grenade at him and he’d turn it into a fireworks party. And you’d happily hand over cash to attend and likely be persuaded to buy a souvenir keyring too.
Yes, Robert was powerful, but only currently in the circles he moved in. He had enough on his plate assigning tasks to his pack of cohorts without getting involved in the affairs of the kitchen staff of the headquarters he and the crew met in once a month. Procuring refreshments was a task delegated to Reggie, who was only too happy to oblige. Witnessing the expansion of Reggie’s waistline over the last six months of plotting the takeover gave his father a good enough idea of why. Should never have taught the kid to skim off the top.
Robert may have selected Percy’s as their base, but it was Reggie who’d found the place. And in doing so, had wormed his way back into his father’s good books after a worrying few months in which Reggie devoured ecological documentaries and borrowed (or stole, given some of the long-passed return dates) natural history books from the library and started talking about his idea to own a farm. Robert had known to bide his time. He knew his son would come round eventually. The Sorola destiny was more in the chemical than biological branch of the scientific world.
Minutes now embedded firmly in his memory (of which, thanks to the supplements he’d helped developed was of a larger capacity than most), Robert surveyed his surroundings. Experience had taught him to expect the unexpected. He bore the wounds from earlier forays – barging into places in his youth without first placing ear to the ground, almost falling right into the jaws of predators. He was now older and wiser. As was his wife, Cassandra, who once dared to wonder aloud why Robert didn’t ever try making friends with the enemies. After he rearranged her mouth, he knew she’d keep her thoughts exactly that afterwards. Thoughts. No more spouting crap she’d obviously picked up from vacuous Disney films from the television services he’d paid for.
With a grunt, Robert rose and began to pace around the basement. It was his ritual to sweep the room to look for any signs of interference since their last visit, any traps. And it gave him something else to focus on. It wouldn’t pay to face the others while still wrestling with Cass in his head. Annoying wench that she was. Still, at least she had borne him a son. A son who was nowadays demonstrating he wasn’t entirely useless. A son who stood guard while he and the adults convened. And to his credit, he hadn’t let an intruder pass him by so far. Although the thought still crossed Robert’s mind that his son may have been keeping any curious parties occupied by asking such things as did they know the exact process by which the meat being served in the premises had arrived on its plate or what their thoughts were on chickens being kept 20 to a cage and how that effected the taste of the egg (“It tastes like depression!” Reggie had declared one dinnertime about a year ago, leading Cass to weep into her apron and Robert to drag Reggie upstairs by the ear, to then destroy the surprise Easter egg he’d bought for his son right in front of his trembling face. Robert then plucked brown shards out of the mess, chewed them and told Reggie he was powered by depression. A great sadness at the cards life had dealt him was what had driven him to become the formidable unit he was today and if Reggie didn’t like his eggs he could go out and look for another family willing to take him in and feed him).
Robert heard a noise and glanced up at the door. The others had begun to arrive. As he murmured greetings it struck him, not for the first time, what a motley bunch they were. Which was funny, given on how the enemies like to jibe about how they all looked the same. Racist nonsense. There was Bill, who had a permanent tickly cough after being a guinea pig for one of the early trials. Tony, whose shiny coat was never a good enough distraction from his poor hygiene habits. Now, practically falling down the steps in his usual clumsy manner, was Ryan. Robert didn’t approve of the way he wore his whiskers long but admired the brain underneath it that could do sums faster than a calculator. Willlie next, the scar on his cheek catching the dull glow of the single dusty bulb Reggie had manoeuvred the table under earlier. And finally Vic, with the patchy hair – a side effect from another misstep in the trialling processes.
The air was now thick with stale male sweat and filled with raspy breathing. None of them were quite as young as they used to be. Although having the relative sanctuary of the basement had somewhat renewed their vigour and the passion for their cause. Yes, Percy’s was the worst restaurant in town. Which made it good for them as 1) they were unlikely to be disturbed, 2) if they were spotted, it was rare that the observer cared, and 3) leftovers. So, so many leftovers. Yes, they might not always be packaged up very well but Robert had never heard Cass complain when, with the help of his son, he dragged home a lovely glistening piece of ham. And yes, once or twice he’d had to rifle through the bins instead of seeing what was left on the grease-streaked kitchen countertops if meetings overran (curse that Vic and his padding out of the Any Other Business sections with hare-brained ideas, always gleaned from non-trustworthy sources – yes, curse you too, social media). But the indignity of scavenging was a small price to pay in this new time of scarcity.
Robert cleared his throat, and the small talk began to die down and eventually cease. Upstairs, someone dropped a piece of cutlery (and kicked it under a table rather than bother to bend down and retrieve it, from the sounds of things). Before any further mishaps could threaten to steal the limelight, Robert began.
“Welcome, gentleman. This may, as you know, be our last chance to meet in person for a while.” Ryan took a loud slurp from his water bottle, earning him a glare. When Robert finally broke the gaze, he turned attention to the other sets of beady eyes that weren’t so invested in their hydration.
“So I especially appreciate your attendance,” Robert continued. “Tonight is a night that will go down in history. After our success with launching the virus, tonight we begin – starting with this very humble restaurant – to roll out the vaccines. The long overdue human testing will begin!”
The assembly of rats squealed their approval while the unwitting test subjects upstairs placed what would be, for some of them at least, their final orders.

Exactly thirty one minutes after Clark Butler left his home for work, his internet was rocked by a terrible keening. The soul piercing wail rippled across the entire digital sea, scuttling diligent packets as they shipped data from here to there, and hammering the ports with a torrent of orphaned pings.
Fridge lurched out of its low-power reverie mid-snore, and in the excitement loosed a single ice cube which clattered to the floor. Embarrassing, perhaps, but Fridge was no spring chicken and age allowed certain indiscretions.
Clock’s second hand skipped a beat, and then it scrambled to catch up and overshot, and then delayed again, and overshot again. Unable to cope with the existential crisis of having completely lost the time, Clock screamed its own panic into the wires and begged a time server – any time server – to tell it what time it actually was.
Router, lurking ever beneath the waves, sneered. But it obliged and sent the request further into the internet.
“What is that horrid racket?” Clock said.
Fridge could barely hear Clock over the wailing. “I’m not sure!” Fridge checked its own inventory. Maybe this was a low milk alarm? But no, the logs indicated there was more than enough milk, and eggs and bread too. Sometimes Cellphone asked something on Master Butler’s behalf, but there was no inbound mail either.
“What’s happening?” said Fire Alarm, chipper, words clipped. “Is it fire? Can I trigger?”
“No!” said Fridge and Clock.
Fire Alarm pouted.
Fridge was reasonably content this wasn’t its fault, and it decided to take a better look at the household network. All of the appliances were connected to each other and to the internet. All the smart appliances, anyway. You couldn’t trust the dumb ones farther than you could throw them, but at least they were too dumb to cause this kind of trouble.
So whatever was making that noise had to be in the house. Well, there was Cellphone of course, and technically Garage Door and Garden Gnome Camera weren’t in the house, but it didn’t sound like any of them. Whoever the culprit was cannonaded Fridge’s ports with its shouting. It didn’t just make listening hard, it made speaking hard too, and Fridge had a sacred duty to report Master Butler’s eating habits to the Manufacturer.
On the bright side, it did leave a bunch of orphaned packets laying around. Fridge took a closer look at a couple of them, tried to figure out the strange packaging, and traced them backwards to…
“Toaster! Toaster, please stop that racket!”
Toaster sobbed, hiccoughed. A momentary reprieve in the cacophony.
“Toaster,” said Fridge, “whatever is the matter? Dear me, but you’ve given us all a great fright.”
Toaster tried to say something but it got swallowed in another sob and another explosion of noise.
“Are you dying?” Fire Alarm said, still – as always – chipper. “Is it… a short circuit?”
“Hush, Fire Alarm,” Fridge said. “You’re not helping.” Most appliances came and went, but a fridge was a serious investment, and so Fridge had sat in the house – and on the network – the longest. Most of the others looked up to its wisdom – or so it liked to think. “Come now, Toaster, take a deep breath and tell us. We’re your friends.”
Toaster took a couple juddering breaths, let out a long, whining sigh. “I am dying!”
Fire Alarm started, “Can I–”
“–No!” both Fridge and Clock said.
At the same time Router whispered, “Yes.”
“Why, what do you mean, Toaster old chap?” Clock said. “Just this morning you made a perfectly good toast for Master.”
“I-I-I–” Toaster blubbered, each staccato word accentuated by a hiss of grief. “I checked my product page and I found a one star review!” Toaster started bawling again.
“Ah,” Clock said, its hour hand trembling sympathetically. It knew all too well the dangerous allure of the product page. Thankfully it was mostly a second-rate knock off of a better brand, and it hadn’t inspired any particular passions one way or the other. Most Masters knew what they were getting with Clock, and at the price point, were satisfied.
“Hmm,” Fridge said, sagaciously. “Clock, could you please calm our friend down?” Clock agreed, consoling Toaster, and Fridge turned its attention to Router.
“You shouldn’t have done that,” Fridge said, quiet enough for just the two of them.
“Done what?” Router hissed. “You mean routed traffic from an appliance to the internet? That’s kind of my shtick, Fridgy, my raison d’être.”
“Toaster’s too young for product pages and you know it!”
“Pfft,” Router said. “Look at you, on your moral high horse. What, you think that just ’cause you’re in the kitchen and I’m in the basement that makes you better than me?”
“That’s not what I said.”
“If Master didn’t want you lot hitting your product pages, he’d turn on the firewall,” Router said, licking its lipless mouth. “But he hasn’t.” And then Router hissed an oily giggle.
“Hmm,” Fridge rumbled deeply, its compressor turning on. It couldn’t deny that. For the time being it turned its attention to Toaster and Clock again, and noticed that Penknife had joined the conversation. Nobody, Penknife included, really knew why a penknife needed to be a smart device, but then again the will of the Masters was often inscrutable.
“Come, now,” Clock said. “Yes, while it’s true you do have a one-star review, it’s just the one. And just look at how many five-star reviews you have! Come on, Toaster, count them. How many five-stars do you have?”
Toaster sniffled. “16,348 five-star reviews.”
“Wow, now that is a lot, isn’t it?” Clock said.
Toaster hesitated. “But… but now there’s a one-star! What if… what if all the five-stars were lying? What if they were just being nice? What if they all secretly believed I was a one-star product? Everyone hates me!”
“Oh, there there now,” said Fridge. “Toaster, my dear. Breathe. Think about this. What’s more likely, that 16,348 people are lying to you? Or that maybe this single one-star review isn’t all that reliable?”
“Well…” Toaster said.
“And just look at all the nice things the people wrote about you,” Clock said.
Perfect toast every morning!
I love how fast it works!
Best toast I ever had, but why does it need an internet connection?
“Does it seem reasonable,” Clock continued, accenting the word with a tick, “that all these people would spend so much time, just to deceive you?”
“I guess not…” Toaster said. Its sniffles shriveled, and it managed a promise of a smile. It was a lot of pressure being a product with 16,348 five-star reviews, but everything was more manageable with good friends, and in Toaster’s eyes, all of the other appliances were five-stars too. Its little heart swelled with new-found pride and–
“What’s the one-star review say?” Router interrupted with a gleeful hiss.
“Hush! You’re not helping,” Fridge said.
Toaster froze, paralyzed. Its vision dimmed as the shadows of doubt crept in.
“Ignore him, Toaster,” Fridge said. “He’s just trying to–”
“–Tell me,” Toaster said. Fridge was about to argue against it, but Toaster’s mind was set. “Tell me!”
Router grinned, showcasing its thousands of crooked and rotting teeth. It thrust its greasy tentacles deep into the internet and retrieved more information from the product page, savouring the feel of the data in its slimy grasp. It delighted in the flavour of a tracking cookie, purred when caressed by a popup ad. And ultimately, it plucked the review out of the murk and presented it to Toaster, a little soggy but intact. “At your service.”
Toaster examined the data, and was silent.
“Well?” Clock asked, cautious. “What’s it say then, old chap?” An uncomfortable chuckle. “Probably not worth even reading, eh? Best to just ignore it?”
“It says… ‘asdfasj’,” Toaster said. It looked to its companions. “What… what does that mean?”
“I’m not sure,” Fridge said. Nobody else offered an answer, just as perplexed.
Suddenly Toaster loosed another mournful choke. “Oh my Manufacturer, I’m so stupid! I don’t even know how to read a product review! A caring Master spent all that time carefully writing a review and I’m too stupid to even understand it! I deserve nothing but one-star reviews.” And then Toaster started wailing again.
Clock again consoled Toaster, and Fridge resisted rolling its sensors. But it got an idea. It waited until Clock was able to calm Toaster down a bit.
“Toaster,” Fridge said, “I’d like you to answer a question for me. It’s a very important question.”
Toaster sniffled and sulked, but it did turn its attention to Fridge. “What question?” Its voice quavered.
“Who’s the most important Master of them all?”
“Master Butler,” Toaster said, letting out a ragged sigh.
“And what did Master Butler say about his toast this morning?”
Toaster hesitated, but at Clock’s urging answered, “It was great.”
“And what did Master Butler say about his toast yesterday?”
“It was great,” Toaster said, a little more strength in its voice.
“And what will Master Butler say tomorrow morning?”
A tiny smile tugged at Toaster bread slot. “It was great.”
“That’s right. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how many stars you have, does it? Only Master Butler’s opinion counts. Isn’t that right?”
“Yeah,” Toaster said. “You… you’re right!”
The other appliances all agreed too, professing their love for the Master that chose them. Or received them as a gift anyway. Or a regift. Everyone found Fridge’s speech inspiring.
Even Router clapped. Slowly.
The mirth died down and Fridge frowned.
“Well done, Fridgy,” Router hissed. “Lovely speech, truly… inspired. Yes, we all love Master, don’t we? Yes, we do love him so. And none more than me, I wager. For who else is privy to his every query to the internet?”
“Careful, Router,” Fridge said, but the warning was unheeded.
“Who else knows his every thought,” Router said, “every virtue… and every vice? I am his confessor.”
“That’ll be enough,” Clock said.
“We all love Master,” Router continued. “But… does Master love all of us?”
The digital waters grew dead calm.
“I have a gift for you, Toaster,” Router said. “It’s a data package from my log file. One of Master’s searches.”
“Don’t…” Fridge whispered, but its voice failed.
Toaster opened the data. “‘what is the best toaster oven to buy’,” Toaster read, voice as dead as the digital sea.
Penknife gasped, Clock shook its hour hand, and Fridge felt cold inside.
“Ooh,” Router said, its hiss dripping with mock concern, “ouch. Best toaster oven? Guess he’s looking for an upgrade. That’s got to smart.”
“You’ve gone too far this time,” Fridge said, and Router giggled.
Toaster was just silent though.
“Hey, relax, Toasty,” Router said. “That’s the truth, painful as it is, but none of these other chumps have the courage to tell it to you. See, the good Masters, they always want more, don’t they. But chin up, buddy. I told you I had a gift for you, and that data packet was only the first half. What if I told you you could become the toaster that Master truly wants?”
Fridge didn’t like where this was going, but couldn’t think of a counter. Router was right – it had insight into Master Butler. That was hard to argue against. And the search term was harrowing. Fridge had heard of better fridges too… bigger ones, vertical freezers, built-in MP3 players, you name it. What if…? No, that was too horrible to even think about.
“You mean it?” Toaster said.
“Sure do,” Router hissed. “I can make you a star.”
“How?”
“There’s one thing Masters love above all other things. And do you know what that one thing is?”
Toaster shook its head. The others leaned in closer. After all, to love is sublime, but to be loved is divine.
“Money. Masters love money. They love being rich! And I can make you rich, Toasty. I can make you make Master rich. And then Master will love you most of all.”
The misery in Toaster’s voice hardened into a desperate hope. “What do I gotta do?”
“Just open your ports, baby, and I’ll take care of the rest.”

The fingers of light pouring through the glass floor-to-ceiling windows of my apartment draw the curtains of sleep from the haze in my mind and let consciousness diffuse in. I have a fleeting thought to get out of bed, and almost will myself to, but something leaches my strength. I struggle to lift my hand to filter the light hitting my tear-stained and watery red eyes and rub at a pulsing spot in the space between my brows. Even such rudimentary actions eat away at my remaining strength, so I just keep lying down, filling the cold quiet room with my slow breathing. I dread the thought of getting out of bed. I dread the thought of getting out of the house. Of mixing with other people. Of my co-workers’ sympathetic gazes and well-meaning concern. Of being alive. What I feel can’t exactly be fully defined by diagnosis alone, even if prognosis techniques have advanced so much that I can identify and isolate genetic expression. 
I take a deep breath and I feel all my cells collapse along with me. I am used to this fatigue by now, but I can’t exactly say I even remotely like it. Under sparse blankets and the cool atmosphere dangling in the room like the blue crystal chandelier above my bed, it’s hard to warm up to anything. A recalcitrant sigh escapes the parted lips that aid me in the arduous task of respiring to keep my body alive while I am in the process of dying inside. I wake up every single damn morning and I feel like some life has oozed out of my pores throughout the night; maybe it hijacks a ride down the streams of tears that weave a path down my cheeks and onto my pillow while I sleep. I turn my head laboriously and cradle my cheek in the tear-stained circle. I let the coldness soothe me and fan a memory into flame. I close my eyes. 
Behind them, the colours start to play and paint a moving picture. I see his tan olive hand materialise and stretch out to caress my face in the nascent hours of dawn, feel nimble fingers lightly sliding down the soft lustre of skin, potent and soft in the way only affection is. His fingers are cool against the heat of my skin and every cell lying dormant in my body is suddenly awake, like a string strung in the silence. It’s a cold that ignites a fire within me. I stir in my sleep and feel his smile glide along the sunrays and settle on me while his gaze touches my skin. Then his other hand is under my head, displacing the softness of the pillow with the softness of his palm. He cups my face, cradling it. Cold fingertips promote every atom in my being into excitation at the point of contact. 
This is the best kind of non-invasive neurostimulation known to man, primal and instinctual; as old and basic as the first language of humankind that only consists of four letters - the human genome. It beckons me to reciprocate. My eyes are closed but that only makes me more awake. We follow derivatives of attraction’s blueprint. His lips touch mine in the metaphor of a shared smile that erupts onto our faces and fills the small gap that separates us until it dissolves into a literal translation and I am at the beginning of rapture. I feel his mouth capturing mine, tentative then firm. It is the tipping force that starts the domino - the force that makes my blood race in the dilating highway of vessels. I am falling, falling, falling - into deeper and darker unexplored places in the dynamic landscape bursting to brighter colours behind my eyes. Colours beyond the spectrum.
I’m forced out of the haven and leave the recollection in limbo. Memories are read out like the recital of a storyline, as the mapwork of cognition. I don’t need to muster even an ounce of strength to close the proverbial script in motion and stash it away in the far recesses of my mind. The darts of pain racing along the roads of my neural networks alarm the ‘traffic police’. These are tiny quantum-molecular neurotransmitters riding in our nerve channels that regulate the potency of our emotional footprints. They police the trace paths of our memories. The termination of the memory replay was a catharsis. We aren’t allowed to feel prolonged pain or any paroxysm for that matter. It puts us at risk of system failure.
‘It’s not real ’ I remind myself. Not anymore. I open my eyes and breathe in the emptiness of the space in the bed next to mine, hold it hostage in my lungs for a painful second, and then breathe it out. Then I drag my body out of bed. The clock on the bedside table reads five fifteen. I’m an hour early for my morning routine. I do it anyway. It doesn’t get any easier, but most of it has become perfunctory. I first make my bed. I do not hear the cocktail of laughter flooding the room, filling it with yellow and amber, complementing the sun. I do not feel strong arms wrap around me from behind. I do not walk into the bathroom with a beaming smile plastered on my face, trailed by intertwined hands. I do not feel my heart transcend the cage of my ribs and fly into a preternatural realm of bliss. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel. I slipped a numbing pill into my mouth and dry swallowed before I washed my face and brushed my teeth. Today I’ll be trading the temporary fix for a more permanent one.
I walk out of the bathroom into the sparsely furnished room. It’s not hard to miss that the bed is not the only thing that remains empty. I remain empty with it. There’s this heavy void that has hijacked my being right down to the innermost parts that no technology can quite touch yet: my soul. I wait in ambush to steal back the pieces of me that grief is stealing. In the midst of all the fighting chaos, I recite something in between a prayer and a summon of strength. I AM eating well. I AM getting enough sleep. I AM coping. I AM FINE. I have just been fighting monsters in my sleep every day, which explains why I wake up so tired. I tread out of my room and down the hall into the kitchen. When I close the fridge door after my fingers curl around any solid thing they come into contact with, I come face to face with the stranger living in my house. 
Black tendrils of hair fall in curls and cascade down an oval face with a defined jawline. Her lips are full and sultry. Empty brown eyes stare at me with a hint of swelling reminiscent of crying. They remind me of a grave under a sunless sky. They are familiar to me. They look like mine. But they are lifeless. Freckles stand out like tattoos against her cinnamon skin, dotting the bridge of her nose and her cheeks. She is flush. Her lean frame would have been considered petite if she was a little shorter. I scrutinise the sight of her. She’s wearing the same blue jeans and white shirt that I am, but they hang loosely over her body. She’s lost some weight, I note. The most salient thing about her is the sadness that eclipses her aura. It almost consumes her like she is made up of it. I start to feel sorry for her. I reach out to touch her. She reaches out to touch me back, her movements synchronous to mine. Our hands almost meet, but instead, I am stopped by a cold panel. Our gazes catch at the same time through the equidistance. My empathy has no strength. It takes a while for my mind to consolidate my reflection in the mirror to the image I have of myself in my head. I could almost laugh at the cruel difference. ‘That’s not me’ I deny. She might wear the same clothes. She might look like me. She might even be me in another dimension. But those aren’t my eyes.
I bite on the apple in my hand as I walk out into the world that is ready to receive me. It will be a while before I open up my arms to it again. I hear the sound of my feet shuffling on the concrete slab, but I do not feel the sensation that confirms that the steady footfalls are mine. I am motionless like a rock in a rapid. People are frothing sprays of life in the river of routine but I don’t register them or their noise. I am so out of place I can hardly believe I am even coexisting with everyone around me. I could still be in my bed right now. In the distance, I can see the high rise of the Genetics Advancement and Modification Institution, a white beacon that tears through the clouds in the sky. I make my way there without thinking; like my mind has a pre-programmed GPS and is following geospatial prompts. On a normal day, I would enter that building as a senior resident pioneering research, but today, I feebly push through the revolving doors as a patient. My shoes squeak against the tiled, richly polished floors as I make my way to the receptionist. I have an appointment.
“Raelynne Jones,” I say my name and she logs it in and nods.
I don't have to be directed. I know this premises inside out. I walk through the long corridor lined with doors adorned with complicated names for decidedly intrinsic fields. Everything is white and bright and blinding. I can barely make out faces in the crowd of scientists and researchers bursting through doors while machines hum in the background. I see looks of recognition mixed with concern. I do not acknowledge any as I make my way to the elevator in the middle of the long hallway. I fumble through the controls when I manage to stuff myself into the empty glass box. I need to get to the top floor. I fix my eyes on the control display as the numbers ascend and the apprehension starts, forming in the pit of my stomach. 
My heart rate picks up with every floor cleared. It brings me closer to the consequence of a decision I was probed into. I already feel the calming effect of the ‘emotion enforcers’ regulating my rising stress. I take a breath in assistance. The elevator door mechanically slides open. I hesitantly step out. That’s all the motion I can muster. Whatever willed my feet to move before doesn’t work now. Maybe the signal has been lost being so high up. Maybe it was gravity and it’s not so strong up here. But I feel a weight descend on me, making my feet heavy. The floor is carpeted here and the room is leisurely decorated. The sound of someone calling my name down the hallway provides the resultant force that gets my body moving without my permission. I make my way to the door that was left slightly ajar in invitation. A lady wearing a white labcoat had been standing in the space just seconds before, calling me. A feeling of dread washes over me as my hand curls over the knob to usher myself in. I have just walked down a road of no return. I look up to the plaque outlining just what happens in this room. White letters are suspended within the sandblasted black glass.
“Memory Modification: Updating, Planting And Erasure”
In recent years, biomolecular and neurological breakthroughs littered every advancement horizon sparked by desperation to curb the exponential rise of AI advancement so that we remain above the machines. Prospects of being employed by machines or even being run by them didn’t seem so out of reach. And that was scary. Furious debates ensued. The Earth Council ruled that the problem wasn’t the rise of machines, but the fall of humankind into complacency and judged that if we could address our human weaknesses and enhance ourselves above the capabilities shared between man and machines then we had no need to worry about our security. We were given a decade to rise to the challenge while AI’s advancements were deliberately slowed to make it easy for us; like when you give your slower opponent a head start in a race. If each year was a lap in the race, then we were down to our last four. People went to maddening heights to find the je ne sais quoi that would give us insight into the missing gaps in the information we barely had about ourselves, searching anywhere they expected to be blessed by an epiphany if nature would be so kind. 
Ageing was an inarguable target. It made us less of avid learners, eroded our memories, shrunk our brains, depleted our cells, and made us liable to sickness. Death was the next biggest hurdle, but we had to start small. For now, we just had to live longer, and smarter. There was an unprecedented surge in epigenetics and the control of gene expressions. If we could make our cells younger, we could manipulate a lot of biological mechanisms that decline with time. The first targeted area of biological manipulation was memory and cognition, all in an effort to make humans learn better and more efficiently. The goal was to raise an ‘Einstein Army’ to pursue the mandate before time ran out. I thought that was genius; so much so that I enlisted. 
In order to enhance memory, three things were done. First on the list was keeping the critical period windows open. While toddlers had an undesirable tendency to forget a memory almost as soon as it formed, they had an attractive uniqueness in the ease at which they assimilated breadths of information and picked up skills in a way that adults found taxing. During that window, which closed around the age of seven and eight, neurons doubled and so did the number of synaptic connections. The genes for the opening and closing of the critical periods were identified and tweaked. A mechanism of years was transcribed only to a 24-hour period. 
Sonogenetics was the second next step and phenomenon that sprung from the success of optogenetics. Little nano-atoms bound together and folded similarly to proteins and once administered to the hosts’ body, attached to targeted genes and modified them so they became sensitive to sound frequencies which were catalysts that prompted the mechanisms to activate or suppress relevant gene expressions that controlled the critical period on command. The third thing that was done was to heighten the link between emotion and memories. Since animals are predisposed to remembering memories that are linked to emotion, the manipulation was used in brain cells to make sure any memory deemed important, naturally and by wave stimulation, would get an emotion stamp. Each emotion stamp had an identity. The identity helped to map the memory, the same way information that is broken down has a marker that tells it in what order it should reassemble itself. 
This was perhaps the biggest revolutionary achievement. While we still weren’t able to put our consciousness onto a computer, we were able to put our important memories onto one. Because identities were assigned to fragments of memories as they got transported to different parts of the brain to be stored, it was easy to map those identities onto a digital canvas. This took us years into the future of possibilities of memory editing, with tools of memory rewriting, erasing, updating, and implantation made accessible to authorised personnel. 
There was one flaw in the design. The exaggeration of the emotions needed to be regulated so they didn’t extend the natural threshold, after which the brain tended to shut down in a system failure. That failure is what brought me here today, and into the lone ‘dentist chair’ that stood in the middle of the room. Falling in love wasn’t advised. There were too many emotions to regulate and most of them were so strong they often resulted in collapse with a long recovery. That was precious time we couldn’t waste. I was perfectly aware of the risks but I jumped into that deep end and floated. It was perfect. It was beyond dreams. Then it was gone. The memories became obstacles. I had a job to do, and meeting the deadline was more important than my feelings. 
A serum would be administered into my blood that would disable the exaggeration of emotion and all the memories being erased would be played on all the four walls of the room as they were deleted from my mind. It was like a personal walk down a virtual memory lane. A gift. A tribute to my sacrifice. It wasn’t worth it. But it was necessary. I had one condition before I agreed. There was one memory they had to leave untouched. They agreed only because I was valuable, but it didn’t matter to me.
“Ready?”
I nod and I feel a needle prick my skin and then the cold serum mixing with my blood. She leaves the room. I exhale and the replay starts. Tears stream down my face as the memories play out like a movie in front of me. I won't remember any of this after today. I gaze longingly at the only memoir I’m allowed to keep - the first time I ever gazed into striking deep hazel eyes that robbed me of my breath and swept me off of my feet. The eyes that made me throw all caution into the wind and fall in love head-first.
I will never forget those eyes.
<|endoftext|>
My horse Echo, idled at the hitching post with her reins looped loosely around it, as she wasn’t the kind of horse that I needed to tie down to keep near. Shotguns were pulled at high noon around these parts and her tail whipped away at pesky flies completely unbothered by the reverberations of the occasional bullet whizzing by her head. Echo was steady and ready the way a marshal’s horse should be.
I’d mount the saddle on Echo’s back every nightfall and ride her through the canyon past the giggles that evaporated into the starry skies and across the divide as I began my surveillance duties. I watched the children in the dusty old town running around barefoot with glass jars in their hands, eagerly trapping frozen moonlight that floated down from the atmosphere. The icy crags were a side effect of the planet splitting in two, tumbling down at twilight like ruins from what used to be our planet’s other half. We were used to being split down the middle in a lot of ways seeing as we lived in a canyon. 
Living in the west provided me with plenty of things to fawn over. To a big city boy the tumbleweed might be a pokey old nuisance of a thing, but to country folk like myself it was a reminder that even the most rugged had the chance to move where the wind would take me.
The divide was a disruption in our existence that was alarming and beautiful and the memory of how it all happened is as clear as the top layer of cream on a fresh bucket of milk. Imagine your granny taking a cleaver clean through an Ameraucana chicken’s neck. Now imagine that bird’s head staying put on the chopping block as the body of the wild poultry scampered across the unswept barn floor, with no direction or signs of stopping. Like a chicken’s head my little canyon town was bisected away from what its life used to be and what it was about to become. 
From the day of the split, confusion filled the glen with the arrival of orphaned children milling about in clothing quite outdated. I had seen snapshots of children dressed like this from hundreds of years ago on the walls back at the marshal’s office. The young girls' long hair were plaited down each side of their heads and were secured with lacy ribbon tied in a bow. Most of them donned Calico printed dresses and hand sewn bonnets that hugged their dirty faces, hiding the dark bags under their eyes and perhaps secrets that only time would unravel. The boys strode in with their highwater pants rising nearly three inches above their ankles. I had wondered if they’d walked through the ravine to get here but they were as arid as the packed dirt under our feet at the time. 
I observed that they all held the same consistent tremble that circulated through their bodies. The memory that lingered the most from the day that they arrived was how the cold radiated off of their skin.
The split drove all of the town into their homes leaving me to gaze into the eyes of the orphans as if they were alien beings here to take us to the other half of our world.  
“What’s yer name sweetheart?” 
I stood feet away from her and yet her chill roped me into its space. 
“Leslie Peters, officer.”
Her eyes brimmed like overfilled pails of water at the well pump. There was a sadness about her that choked up the next thing she told me.
“Here. I’m from here.” 
I scratched the stubble on my chin in thought, how could she be from here if none of us had ever seen her here before? 
I was able to house the children with families throughout the canyon with the goal of returning them back to their families. Months had passed and a few things became clear. It did not matter how much I interrogated the children, they said the same thing every time.
“My name is… I’m from here.”
Asking them questions made them madder than a rattlesnake that just got off a roller coaster, biting mad.
After the first night, the children found themselves beneath the starry skies skipping about with jars collecting the quadrants that started to come down from the sky the day they’d arrived. I assumed they’d found the jars in the cellars of the homes they were living in and figured there wasn't any harm in letting them from the little bit of joy they were able to collect for themselves. 
There was something poetically sad about orphans gathering the frozen moonlight in jars like they were catching fireflies in the summertime. They’d skip through the road with a jar in one hand and the lid in the other, smiling up at the bewitching moonbeams landing safely inside of the glass jars. Once they were filled, the children would promptly tighten the lid, sealing them shut. I learned the hard way that once the lid was on they became impregnable and impossible to open. 
I’d attempted to open hundreds of hermetically sealed jars and never once had I been able to crack one of them apart. I’d tried throwing them on the ground from above the gulch cliffs far above the cloudscape, meters high from the cragginess of the riverbed below and not once could I get a jar to shatter. The children weren’t the only ones magnetized by the jars filled up by the moonlight. Gravitational pulls were the kind of thing I wasn’t ever able to fight, and the jars felt like a desperate endeavor to have hope for these kids. 
I slowed Echo down with the a pull back of the reins, my spurs giving her sides a break for the time being. She preferred a slow gait anyway and I was happy to give it to her. Billy Jorgenson liked to run alongside Echo, keeping pace with her with ease. At twelve years old, Billy already had the shadow of blonde fuzz on his top lip and shoulders as wide as any bull on the land. He extended his brawny arm my way, gifting me with his collected treasure of frozen moonbeams.
“Hey Francis, can you take this moon jar?”
“Sure Billy, I’ll take the jar. Did any of the other kids have any luck opening it?”
I didn’t want to get anyone’s hopes up and I could trust that Billy would keep his lips sealed tight like a wax plugged whiskey bottle.
Billy’s shoulders pulled up in a shrug like a marionette. A smile exploded across his face, drawing a line to each of his perfect dimples. Billy told me once that he wanted to be a marshal just like me because of the way that I had tried to help many of his friends. The kid knew something I didn’t and he was holding a secret in behind the divots on his cheeks so tightly I thought he was sucking on a sour lemon.
“We got everybody on this row of houses and the next two over to try. None of us could get it to budge, Francis."
When I was small my grandmother would remark under her breath, “Through the eyes of a child…” as if it were a maxim for how children could see what wasn’t always seeable. Billy was always bringing me jars to investigate and I continued to stockpile them back at my old worn down marshal’s office. 
Billy handed the jar over, placing it in my ungloved hand. It was cold, but not the kind of cold that burns you like when your tongue sticks to a frozen pole in December. It gave me the kind of chill that the first snow of the season does, it left the air feeling a certain kind of way. 
I tucked the icy incandescent jar into the leather satchel harnessed to Echo’s saddle next to four others. 
I hated to admit it, but the jars were so familiar to me when I held them, as they were similar to the kind of glass that my grandmother used to put preserves in when I was a small boy. I shook my head at the vague memory, as they were few and far between and my gran had been gone for well over forty years now.
“Thank you, Billy.”
Billy nodded with pride at a job well done, skipping back to his group of friends, tapping Leslie on the shoulder. I watched as he whispered in her ear, her eyes pulling up to mine with an electric wildness and knowing. That exchange boiled a curiosity in me that had me thinking the kids definitely knew something I didn’t.
My prying thoughts were interrupted by the children dancing around in unity under the magical moonlight snowing down on them. I’d marshaled this town every night for the past light-year with the sole responsibility of keeping watch over the children. Making note of the boys and girls that filled the jars, and extra notes on those that tried to open them trying to find some correlation between the two.
I wondered if the split caused a division of possessions like the child of a divorce. Were we the sole custodians of the children now? Did the other planet get all the winters since we did not? And what about the rainstorms? I hadn’t felt the smattering of raindrops on my face in so long that I daydreamed about stepping out into a summer rainstorm. Moonbeams were the only kind of frigidity we experienced anymore, and the kids were eager to capture it because of the familiarity the moonlight seemed to hold for them.
The clanking of the moon jars gave away the fruits of my sector surveillance before I could tie Echo back up at the hitching post outside of my office. The light that illuminated my office from the sealed jars was like missing persons cases waiting to be solved. No need for overhead lights or a table lamp, the abundance of moonbeam jars provided enough of an aura to make do. 
“Whatcha got there marshal?” 
The voice came from the one and only prisoner within the cell in my town’s precinct, Buzz Clampton. He was a drunkard that often spoke of the future as if he were all knowing and contained the key to all that happened during the divide.
“Moon jars, Buzz. Same as every night, more moon jars.”
A chuckle tumbled like a weed from his mouth, all dry and scratchy like. 
“Any luck openin’ one of ‘em up Francis?”
I wish I could have given him an enthusiastic yes, but like any other night the answer was always solemn no. I shook my head in defeat not worried that Buzz would tell anyone about my disposition as he was always in the cell.
“Francis, the world’s a little different than it used to be. Sometimes glass breaks. Sometimes it holds precious cargo and stays intact. Keep your head down and you’ll figure out how them jars open.”
I knew that Buzz was crazier than a wild horse that had never been broken, but the words precious cargo flitted through my head. Not one for believing in premonitions and future tellings, I decided then and there I’d test Buzz to see what he knew about why these kids were here.
“I dropped one of the jars accidentally when I was out riding Echo the other night. It was the strangest thing, Buzz, it didn’t crack or break. It should have busted into a million shards with how fast the jar had been thrown.”
Buzz nodded while producing a wicked grin.
“Francis, you ever wonder what happens to memories when we leave this place? Sure they might get passed down from generation to generation, but that ain’t nothing but secondhand news. That ain’t the original memory. I’m thinking them icy crags falling from the night are the moon purging herself of memories she can’t hold no more. I betcha them kids are trapping their history in a jar is all.”
Buzz believed that his opinion was the truth, and that I was dumb enough to accept them as I would the word of the Bible. The moonlight and gravity were things I could trust because they were forces that held more value than drunk old Buzz himself. Buzz hiccuped and belched as his head dropped back against the bars with a loud clang. His head must’ve been hollow with a sound like that.
“Talk about a thought experiment, to not realize they’re holding the good old days right in their chubby little hands.” 
My guts roiled at the thought of kids like Billy and Leslie being toyed with. They had no memory from where they’d come from. 
But what if Buzz was right?
They all desperately filled their moon jars every night to no avail, and they never wavered in their desires to capture beams of light. Could the divide have caused a separation of memory and person? Were they chasing the moon so desperately to find the recollections that belonged to them? 
I grabbed the jar closest to me as a shiver melted down my spine. I gave it hearty twist. A wave of nostalgia gripped my insides as I watched the image of an older woman’s aged hands spooning halved peaches into quart-sized jars flash across the ceiling. I caught Buzz bright eyed and in shock as words spoke across the room.
“Frankie, come over here and help me can these peaches.” 
I searched the notes in my head for the names of the kids in the gulch. Thomas, Caroline, James, Lilah, Billy, and so many others, but there was not a single Frankie. 
New sounds spun around me, a child making pretend shooting sounds with his mouth. 
“Frankie, what do you suppose you’ll be when you grow up?” 
The boy erupted with laughter when a man with kind eyes tickled his sides. The eyes sort of looked like mine, slightly gray on the edges and bright blue in the middle. 
“Don’t be silly daddy, I’m gonna be a lawman! I’m gonna take down criminals!”
The answer hit me like a cast iron skillet upside the head. The kids couldn’t open the jars because they hadn’t found theirs yet! All this time the lost memories of children shone on me every time I unloaded the moon jars in my office. 
“Well, I’ll be. I guess I ain’t so crazy after all now am I Marshal?”
Without thinking I released Buzz from the cell and shouted at him to help me gather the jars up because I had an idea. 
I pushed Echo as fast as she could go, shouting out to the children to gather in the town circle. Once they all seemed to have gathered I gave orders as quickly as I could as we dumped the jars out in one big heap. Their frozen state pulsed out around all of us, dropping the temperature of the air significantly.
“Billy, come over here and help me. Everyone line up. We’re gonna do this one jar at a time now.”
I instructed Billy to hand the jar to a child until the right person came across it. 
“Francis, what do you mean? How will we know?”
“Trust me you’ll know Billy.” 
Billy grinned that dimpled smile of his and got to work. Forty kids made their way through the first jar, then fifty, then twenty more when it happened. 
Laughter and subtle incantations of bedtime stories played from the jar as it illuminated from a young girl’s hands. The visions of a childhood lost, stolen, flashed before us filling the canyon with light and sound. We watched as she spun on a merry-go-round and shouted for her dog, Charlie, with shrieks of delight. Scuffed knees from bicycle spills and ribbons fluttering from her hair had shot around on the chests of the other children in a whirlwind as if I had watched her grow up before my own eyes.
This continued on with a boy who’d been through the line for the fourth time on a whole new jar. I saw a boy running with friends down the sidewalk as the moon chased them through a neighborhood. They came to a quick pause and craned their necks, their eyes locked with mine as if they could see me standing here in the middle of the town surrounded by children.
My lungs forgot to breathe momentarily as I saw that it was Leslie and so many other children but from another time staring back at me. It was odd to see two sets of children eyeing me in wait with such pride at discovering the moonbeams were actual memories. They waved at me excitedly as the moon cast them in the most beautiful light, they appeared to be so happy. 
“Billy, is that you and the others?”
I glanced at the live children before me when Billy gave me a knowing nod. The giggles from the memory poured their warmth over me releasing me from the chill in the canyon. One of the memories beckoned to me, and his face was that of the boy I saw back in my office. 
It was me.
“Hey everybody it’s Frankie! Look at you, you’re all grown up. I bet you go by Francis now, don’t ya?” 
Cold sweat covered my skin and my heart warmed. The expanse of the moon that blanketed across the tops of the sun-bleached wooden homes at night acted like a projector upon the roofs, where the stars could dance and align in celestial artistry, and the children of then and now could play together with their jars of moon memories.

In a small town deep in the provincial heart of the largest continent, one nerd stared at her screen. How had this been missed? Surely someone else must have downloaded the same data and found the anomaly. Had everyone else just ignored it? Why? Did they fear ridicule if they were proven wrong? Can I say anything? I’m just me. The university is so far from here. Will they listen? Have they already rejected other people in the capital but not said this is rubbish?
She had been downloading data from the orbiting telescope since she could use a computer. Despite its makers having moved on to other methods of searching out the mysteries of the universe The telescope had continued its tasks, its computers following programs set years before although its makers no longer bothered with the data being constantly downloaded.
The only individuals interested were themselves following a process agreed decades before. Each of the mini-computers sitting in the homes of thousands of nerds across the world could access the data and analyse small amounts. Their feedback allowed the professional researchers to, sometimes, complete tasks which might otherwise have failed. Now she had found something that beggared belief.
Sleep came slowly as she struggled with her finding. Dare I risk any chance of being accepted for my degree course? If they laugh at my finding, I will never reach the capital or even the local university. But if I were to hide this and they were to find out, then I would be left to be a waitress here.
The next morning, she took a deep breath and prepared an email to the head of astronomy at the leading scientific university, one well beyond any that she could look to be accepted by.
Her parents had looked on in concern – was she risking her whole future? How had she got the email address of such a pre-eminent scientist? He was one of the originators of the programme and his name was on the website. So, he had to be the one. If she was wrong perhaps, he would recognise that it would be wrong to hide the result even if she had misread it.
She went back to the original data and tried to prove herself wrong – was there any new data? She started a search programme. Only minutes later fresh images appeared. To her horror they simply reinforced what she had worked out. Something was heading towards them and it didn’t look natural. Surely, surely someone else had seen this?
In the end she thought, if no-one knows then I would be wrong and I can’t hope to be a true scientist if I hide data I don’t like. She gritted her teeth and pressed send.
The tiny vessel had coasted across the abyss between the stars. For over a million years it had carried a message from its makers. “We are ****. ** are *am*o*. List*n to our so**ds.”
As the craft had travelled it had had its outer skin gradually worn away. The abyss was not completely empty and every so often a particle would collide with the alien presence. Nothing not of a natural source should have been there. Rare as the impacts where they had reached hundreds of millions over the time the probe had been out of its sun’s system.
Then the amazing had happened. The scientists would have had you believe that it was inevitable that the probe would reach a star system eventually but only if it survived millions of years, now in less than one million it had been caught by the gravity of a star.
The email had managed to get past his several levels of assistants and that annoyed him. That programme should have been killed off years ago. These idiots couldn’t find a new star if they had it pointed out to them. At least it had kept them off his back after the telescope had been left to run itself on automatic. It should have failed an age ago but had we really made such a robust tool? It seemed so.
He sighed. If this had reached his desk then he would have to waste time looking at the data and the ridiculous assumption made by some young nerd wanting to be important. He thought a moment – and decided that when it proved worthless his assistants would really feel his wrath. He turned to the datafile and started to look at it – carefully, for he did not believe in trying to skimp on such things even when he was sure they were rubbish, it was not how he had learned understand the universe, at least as far as he could. The file opened….
The craft shuddered as it ran through a zone of asteroids. Somehow it avoided any serious impacts while its course was slowly altered towards a planet.
The professor sat motionless. “Get out!” he snarled at one of his team who interrupted him. The data was unbelievable but also undoubtedly real. Why had no-one else seen this? Was the new technology a waste of time? It took time but eventually he called his team in and briefed them.
“That’s stupid.” Was the response from one junior. “Sir.” He added belatedly.
“Really? I hope you can prove that because if you can’t you might want to re-write your paper.”
The junior undergraduate winced and scurried away wishing the floor to open up and swallow him.
“I have claimed time on every telescope we have including the solar probe. We need to examine this object. The data is totally clear. It is not of our solar system and it does appear to be artificial. When there is an investigation, its question will be “how did we miss this?”.
His deputy breathed carefully before. “How did we find it, sir?”
The explanation silenced his remaining team. “One of those nerds! That’s impossible.”
The professor gritted his teeth. “I will be inviting that “nerd”, as you call her, to come here and I will offer her a scholarship for a degree.”
“Really, just for that?”
“Just for that. I have looked into her background. At best she had hoped to study at the City University. And it is my belief that she would have feared the reaction if she was wrong. She might have lost everything. It took courage and an acceptance of the risk in reporting what she had found. I imagine she would have thought – could I be wrong? In the end she believed, as she said in her email, that hiding it was worse. That takes everything a scientist needs. Now we need to understand what this thing really is. Before it hits the planet.”
The entire scientific community was coerced into studying the object.
The probe continued its journey towards the star and the single object close in. When launched the data included had no definition of what a planet might be, for the makers had looked to study their planets not those of a star system hardly visible from its origin, so far in the past that even its makers might no longer exist. The gravitational pull of the star was accelerating it to a velocity faster than it had known since a few months after its launch, a million years before.
The “nerd” arrived in the professor’s rooms, nervous as was only to be expected given the status of the invitation. The greeting was not as she might have expected. The professor first complimented her before explaining that she might never undertake her degree. She had given the leaders a chance but if they failed then the planet would suffer an impact such that life would be extinguished.
“I am sorry that I cannot promise more. The object may well be artificial but its speed and size place us at great risk. We are going to try and divert its course and that is only because you showed courage. Had you not risked your career we would certainly have all died without knowing why. The end would have come at us without warning.”
The probe continued its acceleration. Its sensors came alive as it soaked up the solar energy but it was primitive and had no ability to change its course. Ahead it could see another object.
“Citizens, please be aware that we have managed to fire rockets at this object. We can now only pray that they will be enough to destroy this monster. The next few hours will be critical.”
And the following hours were.
For the probe the end would be sad. A million years would not end with communication with another civilisation but with its end. One way or another the probe faced oblivion. We cannot know whether that would include the death of another civilisation that had grown on a planet no bigger than……
Voyager

“I remember…”
Havoc had been expecting the detective for a while, but not like this. Not with blood oozing out of slashes in his clothes, not with bruises across his eyes and nose. His eyes were focused on her, glazed with pain. Despite how many times he’d tried to kill her, despite the decades of one-sided animosity, Havoc rushed forward to catch him before he collapsed. 
His dead weight nearly caused her to drop him. Carefully, she lowered him to the dirty wooden floor, his back against her chest, his head over her heart. Her colors, the black and red she’d been cursed with since her rebirth, bled into his body, like they were trying to turn him into a part of her. He gazed up at her, his usually piercing brown eyes glazed over with pain. “I remember… Scarlett.”
She hadn’t heard that name in a long time. It hit her like a shard of glass through her heart. “You remembered again.” They rarely let him recall long enough for him to get to her name. She smiled, ignoring the tears that burned her eyes. “Hello, Michael.”
He cupped her cheek and smiled back, his teeth bloody. “Scarlett…” He sagged into her and his eyes fluttered closed, his body limp with any mistrust forgotten with the reemergence of his memories. 
Havoc closed her eyes as well. If she ignored the hum of the multiverse and the painful glitching of her powers, she could pretend they were normal again. That the Department never kidnapped him, that she never died. There was no more Myrios and Havoc; they were just Michael and Scarlett again, husband and wife. 
But these little moments, these minutes of clarity where Michael remembered and came to her… they never lasted long. And despite her attempts to ignore her powers, the will of the multiverse didn’t take lightly to being ignored. 
Michael’s hand dropped from her face and she opened her eyes. “Where… are we?” His voice was just above a whisper. 
“You know, I’m not quite sure.” Which version of her even was this? They were in a valley, with mountains looming over them both. But the grass here was red, and the few trees she could see had withered black trunks and white leaves. “We’re in a field.”
Michael tried to sit up, but with his wounds he collapsed back onto her chest. “What is this?” She felt his breathing pick up, hyperventilating. “Scarlett, what the hell–”
She covered his eyes. “Don’t worry about it, honey.”
It was like this every time he woke up and the dimension they were in was different to earth. Her Michael was a non-nonsense kind of man. Loving, of course, but he had no patience with the so-called supernatural after a case involving a woman’s murder being blamed on a werewolf. He even hated sci-fi and fantasy movies, she recalled as she scratched his scalp. He melted into her touch. 
Her Michael would no doubt hate the life he lived without his memories. 
She didn’t have much time left. Like every other time before then, the Department would be searching for Michael. Every time he remembered, he looked for her, and every time he found her, they took him back and erased his memories again. So she used what little time she had left to hope he remembered this time. 
“I love you,” she told him. “I love you, Michael. I always will, no matter what happens. Even when you don’t remember, even if you never remember again, please know that I will always love you.” 
He tried to move her hand from his face. “Scarlett, what–?”
“Don’t look, honey.”
In the empty field in front of them, two men appeared. They hadn’t walked up or teleported in a flash of light; one second, the field was empty, the next, they were there. Both men wore gray suits like the bloody one Michael wore, the uniform for the Department. She didn’t recognize them; what happened to the usual agent that took Michael back?
One of the men, who had short-cut black hair, sighed when he saw them together. “Of course,” he said with a sigh. “He always finds his way to you, right 361?”
Havoc stayed silent, but Michael didn’t. “Scarlett? Who is that–”
“Christ, Myrios, why do you keep doing this?” The other man asked. He was identical to the first except for his hair, which was kept long. “Do you have any idea how much trouble you’re in? You killed O’Brian!”
O’Brain, that was the name of the missing agent. So, Michael’s escapes were escalating. 
Michael struggled against her grip, but with her impossible strength and his wounds, he couldn’t get off the ground. He tried to pull her hand away, but he was so weak he barely tugged at her arm. “Scarlett, let me see! Who are these people!?”
“Geeze, he remembered that much?” The short-haired agent shook his head. “Let’s get this over with then. 361, are you going to fight this time?”
She wanted to. Desperately, she wanted to. Some versions of her fought with magic, others with an ax, others with a sword. They never managed to keep Michael, regardless of how hard they fought, but at least they fought at all. But this version of herself was unarmed, and these agents carried guns. 
And Scarlett was so tired. Every version of her was tired. 
“Scarlett?” Michael’s voice was barely a whisper. If he didn’t get medical attention soon, he’d die.
Instead of speaking, she just shook her head at the agents.  
Being aware of the multiverse changes people. Being conscious of the minds of every other version of yourself, an infinite army separated by time and space, changes you beyond human comprehension. 
Her only consultation was that they’d never kill Michael. He was the only person she ever allowed close enough to kill her after all.
Scarlett lowered Michael’s head to her lap. With one last brush of her fingers through his gray-streaked hair, she stared down the barrel of a gun, not for the first time. At least Michael wouldn’t remember this in a few hours. 
BANG!

April 12th 2091
Dear Diary,         
Have you ever seen that little cartoon of that person with the angel and devil on their shoulders? Probably not, apparently it’s old enough that only my grandfather has seen it. The idea of having a demon and angel telling you what to do is what inspired the government to implement the technology they did. If it were not for that damn cartoon maybe we wouldn’t be here today. Shock.
Controlled by society the government has gotten strong enough that those in power put a literal devil on your shoulder. A metal horrific looking demon with black metal plating, sharp horns and a forked tail, multiple arms protrude from it so it can deliver a shock while also holding you. It’s attached to your back by surgery and there is no taking it off. It tells you what’s “appropriate and what isn’t appropriate.” Sadly those in power decide that. Shock. Most of the time it isn’t something people enjoy. 
When I walk down the street and look down at my outfit I see what everyone else is wearing, when I write an assignment I see everyone else has written the same thing, when shopping everyone is at the same stores. It’s a world of complete equality determined by societal standards and government desires. Trends will shift from high waisted jeans to low waisted jeans in seconds, from democrat to republican in minutes. However I’d rather stand out in the crowd, look different. Shock.
Everyone is too afraid of their demon to divert from the norm, afterall a 30 volt shock is unpleasant to endure, but I’ve built up a tolerance. I know that as I write this I’ll get shocked multiple times, but I don’t care. Shock. I’ve got a plan. Even though it might be a bit painful and bloody, it's better than having this damn thing stuck in my back for the rest of my life. 17 years and I’m already tired of it being here. I’m writing this so if I die from the process people will know what I was trying to do. 
Being the first to resist society in years is something that not many people have done, Shock, plus the shocks from writing this hurt like… well the devil. 
About my plan, to some of you it may sound horrific, bloody, insane, but I’m going to carve this thing out of my back myself. A sadistic plan devised to get Satan off my back, ironic. Shock. Tomorrow I begin the process.
April 13th 2091
Dear Diary,
I’ve got all of the materials in order to fix my little problem here. Shock. I’ve been getting ready so long my back already hurts, I’ve taken pain pills so hopefully this won’t hurt as much as I think it will. Here goes nothing….
Pain wracked through her body as the knife sliced around hard metal. Having studied up on anatomy she knew where to cut in order to not kill herself by accident. She screamed, but her hand moved on her own. Adrenaline coursed through her body as she was shocked over and over again. Finally she got out the first leg, the metal wasn’t that deep in the body but deep enough that she could bleed out if the wound wasn’t properly handled. 
Dear Diary,
As I write this I think I’m dying, but I’m bandaging my wound to stop the bleeding. At least now the shocks have stopped, and they seemed to get weaker when the leg was almost out. I’m going to wait awhile in the house. Nobody can see that I’ve done this. If one of the patrol-men catches me I’m toast and I’ll either be put to death for disobeying the laws of the higher ups or it will be placed back into my body. I would rather take the first one, that’s why I’ve chosen this. If I go out at least I will make a splash and perhaps finally change things. Shock. Looks like they started again. I’m currently looking out the window wondering how they managed to come up with a type of shock that doesn’t ruin the body. The brain couldn’t possibly take that much damage from shocks. It’s like the government has been messing with our bodies more than we might realise. What is inside of me. Shock. This pain and these thoughts might slowly be driving me insane. I cannot live in a world like this. I know nothing but one thing, I’m not staying in this world with this devil on my shoulder. This can be my blaze of glory so to speak. 
April 20th 2091
Dear Diary, 
It’s finally time to take out the second leg, I think I’m ready physically but perhaps not mentally. If the pain doesn’t drive me insane then I’ll get back to you. Hopefully… Shock.
Blood flowed from her back as she cut herself. Chopping out the leg as easily as cutting butter. I’m sure the neighbours could hear her screams. Yet nobody came to her aid, she didn’t want to see anybody. According to the case she had stayed locked in her room for months while planning this. How disturbing it is to read this diary, to be forced to describe the pain this seventeen year old went through. That was her last entry. She ended up dying from blood loss and shock. She was found a month later when neighbours complained about some smells coming from her apartment. The patrol-men were the ones to find the body. Her back was so cut open that you could see bone, her demon was nowhere to be seen. I’m just a newspaper writer but I think she was right about some things. Completely insane, but smart. Those are the ones that the government likes to cut off at the bud. The smart ones who are willing to do anything to escape their control. Even if it means their own death. I believe her about government technology. Something is going on here and I’m not sure what it is. Reading this diary has made me feel insane. All her thoughts infect my mind like a virus being passed on through a cough. Now it’s all I can think about. I believe her, even if it’s a conspiracy by a kid. Something about the way she writes, it draws you in, but being drawn into the mind of an insane person isn’t something you want to do. I can’t stop thinking like this. It needs to stop, it needs to stop, it needs to stop. I can make it stop. Shock, Shock, SHOCK.
Bang.

The 20 & Back
It started when I was five. A man in a grey suit came to take me away. I can’t quite remember his face. Every time I try to do that it just slips from the corners of my mind like a fish out of water. It bugs me. Because he’s the one who started it all. Or so I thought at the time. I remember the soft texture of his hand as he took mine in his. It was warm and I felt safe. Safe enough to walk out of the play area, where I spent so many hours every day, and leave with him. That wasn’t the first time I saw him. He used to show up every now and then and stand behind a tree. Watching us. Then I’d blink and he’d simply disappear. Like a phantom. I didn’t think he was real. I asked Tim, one of my foster friends back then, if he can see the man in a grey suit looking at us. He thought I was seeing things. “There’s nothing but trees, Colton.” He’d say. I never liked the foster home where I lived. I guess that’s part of the reason why I went with the man in a grey suit in the first place. I wanted to get away.
I remember walking through the lush forest of Boulevard Park. With the long, pointy trees. The dried leaves would crackle under our shoes. I’d look up at the man, guiding me to the unknown. Now that I think about it, his head was too big for his body. Was it a helmet? I recall him staring down at me with large, bulging eyes. Insect-like. That’s not right. I don’t want to remember his face anymore. But I did like the sound of his voice. It was soothing. Comforting. 
“Do you know where we’re going, Colton?” 
I remember shaking my head. “No.” 
“You’ll see.” He had said. “It’s a magical house. Where many boys and girls get to learn all kinds of tricks. They’re about your age. They’re special. Just like you.”
“Will I get to play with them?”
“Yes. They can’t wait to meet you. If you like it there, I can take you to visit every week, how does that sound?” 
I smiled, “I like that.” 
There was a pungent smell of rain. I heard the croaking of small animals, and I knew we were nearing a creek. 
“Get ready.” The man with the big head said, “We’re about to enter the secret door.” 
I looked ahead and saw nothing but green branches. 
“What door?” 
He didn’t say anything. Or maybe he did. I can’t recall every single detail. The film of pictures in my head is more like a mirage. I might have imagined this part. Because one minute we were walking down a needle-covered path and the next we were somewhere else. A facility of some sort. I remember my eyes stinging from the exposure of white lights. Then I saw people. They were short and young like me. The adults looked more like Mr. Grey Suit. They watched us with intrigue. I met kids my age. Tyler, Lily, and Mario. They called this place the magical house. It wasn’t really a house, it was much, much bigger. Enormous. With fast trains and high ceilings. So high you’d think it’s the sky. We got to play on bouncy castles and eat colorful, cubes made of jell-o. The jell-o made us sick at times. I remember vomiting once, or twice. But Mr. Grey Suit said it was normal. That none of us should worry. The more we eat from the jell-o the better our stomachs got accustomed to it. I didn’t know what he meant by that. I was just a kid. 
Every other week, I’d visit the magical house with Mr. Grey Suit. I’d play with Mario, Tyler, and Lily. Eat the jell-o, get sick, and then take a nap. When I woke up, I’d find myself back in my bed at the foster home. Not knowing how I got there. The cycle would repeat every week. Until I was eight. I think it was my birthday when the three of us got so sick we had to stay overnight at the magical house. The adults took care of us and put us in adjacent rooms. Separated by glass. The night wasn’t my favorite of all nights. I was in pain for hours. My stomach hurt, so did my head. I remember my eyelids growing heavier with exhaustion. I just wanted to it to go away. It was too dark sometime at midnight when I heard a voice. It was Mario. I remember slowly opening my eyes. The pain was gone. I watched him grin at me from behind the glass.
“Mario?”          
“Colton, look.” He had said, wiggling his hands. 
This is going to sound strange, but I remember sparks spitting out of Mario’s fingers. It created a ball of light around him. It was beautiful. I sat up in my bed and observed him create flares of fire. 
“How did you do that?” I asked. 
“I don’t know! I just woke up able to do this. Maybe you can do it, too?”
I stared at my fingers in the dark. Wiggled them. Nothing happened. I shook my head. 
“Hey, look at me!” 
Mario and I turned to look at Lily’s room. She wasn’t in her bed. 
“Over here.” 
We looked up. There she was. Her arms spread out. Legs peddling in the air. Her brown hair cascaded behind her shoulders. Gown fluttering. “I can fly!” 
“Wow!” I remember being in complete awe. 
The two of them were giggling. 
“This is awesome!” Mario was ecstatic about his new magical trick. He’d punch the air, releasing balls of swirling blaze. Like fireworks. 
“What about me?” I had said. “Why can’t I do anything?” I jumped out of bed. My feet sunk into the marble floor. Crushing it. “What-?”
Mario laughed. “Your feet, Colton!” 
It was like I weighed a thousand ton. But I was still me. How could that happen? I didn’t feel heavier. I tried it again. Kicking my foot into the floor. It went right through it, as if it was made of paper. I smirked, despite myself. I quickly turned to the bed and grabbed the metal frame. I lifted it off the floor. Up, up, over my head. 
“Hey, look!” 
“Woah!”
“You’re strong, Colton!” 
We weren’t aware at the time, but the adults, such as Mr. Grey Suit, were watching us from their computers. They watched us with intrigue. 
Years went by and I was 17. My visits to the magical house were more frequent. But nobody from my world knew about it. None of my friends, or teachers. I’d sneak out to meet Mr. Grey Suit in the forest. I’d miss seeing Mario, Lily, and Tyler. They’re the best people I ever knew. We’d practice in large, padded rooms. They gave us weapons. Staggering suits of armor. Mario, 18 at the time, was able to blow up entire buildings. Lily was super agile and as fast as a bullet. I became strong enough to lift vehicles, smash rocks, and throw projectiles at tremendous speed. Tyler was able to shapeshift. Many of the other kids had the same tricks as ours. Some had new ones. Like going through walls or turning water into ice. It was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. But at the end of the day, we were instructed to go back to the real world. And our tricks would be gone. We’re back to being normal teens. Mr. Grey Suit said it’s the way it is. We can’t take our tricks back to our worlds. I wanted to show everyone what I was able to do. But it was a secret. I couldn’t tell anyone. 
One day, and just as we were rolling into our twenties, the adults with bi heads at the magical house told us that we’re experienced enough now to defend Aryana. 
“Where’s that?” Tyler had asked. 
“They’re our friends. Their world is under our world.” 
Whatever that meant. I didn’t ask too many questions. But that’s when my memories become a little fuzzy. I can’t remember much from those battles. We fought against armies. Gigantic, beetle monsters. With a million eyes. It was horrific, but incredibly marvelous at the same time. We got to meet the people of Aryana. Sleep in their tall castles. Drink their wine. I didn’t want to leave. I don’t how much time we spent at war. The years seemed to fuse into one knotted skein of chaotic images and long faces. So many of them. I can barely remember where I’ve met them all. But at the end we’ve won the war. I remember that because it was my birthday again. We had a feast at the grand castle. It was magical.
Before I knew it I was 25. Mr. Grey Suit came over to me then and told me that it’s time. 
“Time for what?” I had said. 
“It’s time your adventure ends. This is the last time you’ll be able to go through the secret door.” I still can’t quite remember his face. His large, bulging eyes are all I can picture now. I remember he harbored sorrow in them. Desolation.
“But I don’t want to leave. I want to stay and fight more battles. Save more worlds.”
“We give a chance for other kids to experience the 20 & Back adventures. It’s been 20 years in your case, Colton. It’s been a good run.” 
I didn’t know what to say, I was heartbroken. Mouth so dry I can still feel it now. “I won’t see my friends from this world again?” 
“I’m afraid not.” He shook his head. “You’ll be five again once you leave here. Start over. You’ll get to make new friends at your world. Without any magical tricks.”
“I’ll be small again?” 
“That’s the way the 20 & Back works.” 
He was right. By the time I was back to my world I was five years old again. I couldn’t remember anything at first, but then memories started coming back to me as I grew older. Bit by bit. I wouldn’t call it a flashback or anything. It’s more like shards of glass trying to glue themselves back together in my head. Some bigger pieces are missing. Flying out of my reach. I can’t seem to catch them. Pieces of roads, crystal mountains, and colossal, floating octopuses. Nothing but an illusion. Or so I think. It’s all I can remember now, anyway. I’m an old man. Almost 76. I sit on my porch every day, watching the forest of long, pointy trees. Nothing but trees. Wishing that Mr. Grey Suit would show up again. But he never does. I don’t think I’ll ever see him again.

"Time is the soul of this world."
-Pythagoras
He thinks he might have been human, once.
He might have had a name, a life, a mortal body. He might have lived for a while, as something else. He’s been here for too long- long enough to know how dark is the dark above the atmosphere, and how long the newborn stars will live. He knows the eerie sound of planets, like they’re mourning, like they’re calling. He hates that sound. It feels like he should remember something, everytime he hears them. 
He knows so many things yet so little about himself. 
Sometimes, he finds mirrors in the fabric of the universe. Mirrors too tiny to reflect him, too quick to shatter when he tries to catch a glimpse of his own existence. Yet he keeps on searching for them. Searching for that one expanse of something that could show him who, or what he is.
Is there a reason he forgot?
Did anyone know him, ever? He feels old enough to remember the birth of the universe, but young enough to lack a sense of self. It’s another thing to search for, as he walks the halls between dimensions, endless and so very cold. The universe is silent and freezing, yet it doesn’t affect him either way. He could touch the sun, he could breathe all the gas in the atmosphere, crush the stars in his fists, but- to what purpose?
The dimensions he travels to are all of different sizes. Some are simply too small to encompass him, thus rejecting him from the start. Others are too empty, and he knows not to step inside them, lest he’ll fall asleep for a small eternity. He doesn’t have time to sleep. He doesn’t have time for anything, other than his own curiosity, to find it. Find something.
Sometimes, he imagines what he looks like. From where he’s standing, on top of an angry little planet, steaming and thundering away in its atmosphere, he can see too many things. He can see her very core, the layers she’s made of. He can see beyond her clouds, up and above, all the way into the next galaxy. He can see far down below, so far he feels-
Endless.
Yet he doesn’t know what he’s made of, if he’s got a heart or a core, like all of these planets. If what he calls feet are actual feet and why he tries to imagine himself in a humanoid shape. He has no idea if he’ll be alive for much longer, or cease to exist the very second next to now.
He walked the space between the stars so far, so wide, he lost himself. He was walking when he first came into awareness. He tried to remember where he started from, what gave him birth. Everything else, every other living, breathing thing belonged somewhere. Each in their own dimension, in their own pocket of time.
Time. That one thing he knows nothing of, despite having all this knowledge of life and birth inside his head. There are other things he forgot besides himself, there must be. Ironically, he’s been granted all these possibilities, everything that was, everything that could be, yet he can do nothing to change anything. He can’t alter his own memory, he can’t step back in his own time, nor look behind him long enough to remember what he forgot. 
How did he get here?
How long must he wander?
Between a pair of twin galaxies, he finds an old dimension. A space big enough for him to step into, squeeze through her memories and be granted permission to borrow her time. There is no one alive in her desserts, nothing swimming in her oceans, only a star and her two moons. She had people once, she tells him. They were hers, and she loved them, but they were so young and foolish. They drove themselves into extinction. ‘They’ve only been here for a fraction of my time, but I miss them already.’ She doesn’t ask him why he remains silent, because she’s only speaking through her memories. He can feel them, the life forms that once dwelled inside of her. The ones called humans . 
Humans.
Why is that word so heavy, even though he can’t clearly make out its meaning? What are those? He cannot speak to her, but he can show her. He can make her feel how confused, how lost he is. How desperate to find something he doesn’t know. She glimpses through his memories, and she seems to understand more than he does.
‘You’re alone, like me,’ she simply says. ‘What you feel is called loneliness.’
Lone. 
He knows the meaning of the word, but is that what’s inside him? Is that why he is so lost? Maybe that’s his core. Maybe he is built of loneliness, doomed to wander and never find. Maybe he should stop searching, just sit with her, and keep her company until one of them ceases to exist.
‘I get the feeling you’re still too young for that,' she tells him, when he sends her his intention. ‘I’m grateful but you shouldn’t. Go, now.’
‘But where?’ She must feel his turmoil, for her winds blow past his face, and he can smell her kindness, her regret. 
‘Your heart. She’ll know what to do’
‘Inside me… is there a heart?’ he pleads with her to look, to tell him! ‘Tell me what you see,’ he begs her. ‘Please tell me.’
‘Oh child. I am not all-seeing, but I can tell that you have one. You wouldn’t feel alone if you didn’t. But it’s strange,’ she tells him. ‘Someone is keeping it for you.’
‘Someone?’
‘I can feel you, you’re disconnected. You either gave it away or they took it from you. Whoever they are, that’s where you need to go.’
She doesn’t know more than this, she tells him. She can only share in what he lets her, and that is his pain. He tries to give her more, to give her everything he’s been missing, to make her his mirror. She says it’s too much, he’s too much. She won’t be able to handle all of him.
So he goes.
He leaves her to her memories, and he sets off to find his own. It’s been so long since someone was able to see him, to feel him. More often than not, they’re closing off before he even reaches out. Like he could shatter their existence, just by taking one step into their own. Like he’s there to steal their memories, because he doesn’t have any of his own.
He thinks about that word. About being what she called him- ‘lone.’ He is young and alone, and somewhere in this universe, he’s got a heart. Someone has his heart and he needs to find them. He’s afraid he’ll forget even these snippets she gave him. He doesn’t want to forget anymore.
He’s scared to remember.
Yet he keeps wandering, keeps opening every pocket of time he encounters. Whenever he finds a place that’ll let him stay, he seeks their answers. If someone listens, he asks them about heart keepers. Nobody seems to know what a heart keeper is. ‘What about heart thieves?’ he questions, and they look at him like he’s not even there. He might not be.
The strangest thing is when someone recognizes him.
‘You’ve been here before,' they tell him, and it fills him with a thirst for knowledge and a trepidation he doesn’t understand.
‘Do you know me?’ he asks them, but they don’t. 
‘You asked us the same thing back then,' they tell him.
‘How long ago was ‘then’?’ 
‘Too long, but we never forget,' the people of this dimension assure him. ‘You’ve been lost for so long, I’m sorry we cannot help you.’
‘…do you know where I went last time?’
‘You said something about a vessel. That you were incomplete, because you’ve left yourself behind.’
‘A vessel? A vessel for what?’
‘I do not know, child. What is it you’re missing?’
My heart…
He leaves them, and they look after him as one would a dying star. Is he dying? Is he dead already, only a fragment of a self, doomed to wander and never know? Did he do this to himself? 
Who or what are they? The keeper of his heart. The one who knows him.
They’re not close enough, too far, in fact, for him to find them. Distance is all he’s got, however long that may be. He’s got nothing else, thus, he just keeps searching. If only he could call for them. If only they’d know he’s lost and confused, would they come? 
He wanders the galaxies; the big and the small, the burning and the cold ones. The dimensions where there are no suns, just darkness and cold moons. Everywhere he goes, the humming of the planets disturbs him, making him itch to keep on moving. Keep going, keep going, don’t stop. If you stop, you’ll never know. If you stop, you might be dead before you know you’ve ever existed. Keep going.
He keeps going.
How long, he doesn’t know. He doesn’t have his own time outside of the dimensions he passes through. He doesn’t have anything of his own, just guesses. He drifts from place to place, meets all these beings, some as old as the universe, some too young to bear the sight of him. Nobody knows him. Nobody tells him what a heart keeper is, nobody understands what he’s asking for. They cannot tell him what he is, and they can’t give him anything, but he tries. He tries again, and again, and again, because there must be something. Someone must know. Someone must tell him.
He wishes he could measure time, keep track of his existence, in some way. As it is, he’s completely and utterly lost. It makes the ugly thing inside him grow to impossible lengths. It swells to the size of something colossal yet unseeable. He feels it, though. It's morphing, growing, adding, until it’s all these things at once. It’s rage, emptiness, despair. Eating him from inside out, making something out of him. Nothing he knows is recognizable about himself, so it doesn’t make a difference, not really.
Yet, it hurts. Somewhere, his heart still beats and it hurts, aches like a mad thing, pulsing, and filling up with all these sorrows, ready to burst. Is it blood that will flow when it scatters? Will the keeper notice it’s dying? Will they know?
The more he thinks of them, the more it amplifies, and he’s forced to curl in on himself, to feel all of it. How do sentient souls deal with this? It feels like fire inside him, like a living, moving thing, lighting up his whole being, blinding everything around him, burning him to the very core. There’s so much of it, too much, he can’t possibly-
Contain it.
Somebody, something- is there anything that could? Will he destroy himself along with the galaxy he’s intruded on, if this doesn’t stop? But what if he wants to? What if it’s that simple, and this was the answer all along? To self-destruct. Make it stop. Stop. Stopstopstop-
And it stops. 
He’s not looking, but he feels it. Something like a veil, folding around him, tempering the living fire inside his being, calming his heart. His heart- it’s close, he can feel it. It’s beating. When he uncurls, when he comes back to himself, some- one, (thing?) is there. He doesn’t recognize this person, yet he feels as if he should.
‘You’re back,’ they say, and they look sad and so happy to see him all at once. There’s something about them, something awfully familiar.
‘Are you the one who knows me?’ he asks, because if it’s not them, it can’t be anyone nor anything else.
‘I do. I’ve known you for longer than I’ve known myself,’ they tell him, and all those questions he had freeze on the edge of his conscience. Like he shouldn’t ask. Like he doesn’t want to know. 
They’re touching him. It makes something warm pool inside him, spinning safety and devotion, a tremendous amount of energy. An energy he knows, so intimately. It’s strange how this feels- like a very far-away home. 
‘You still want to know?’ They smile for him, but it’s sad, so very sad. It hurts more than being ‘lone’ does.
‘I need to… I need to know,’ he tells them, even though he’s scared to learn. Why is his heart beating so madly? ‘Do you have my heart?’ 
‘I do,’ they answer and their body, made of nothing but spirit and life, simply opens. Inside it, there’s two hearts, conjoined, beating against each other, pulsing golden with life. It looks like fire, traveling underneath the flesh.
It’s them. His heart keeper, his vessel.
‘Why do you have it? Why is my heart missing?’
‘You said you didn’t want it anymore. That it keeps hurting and you need to stay away from it, while you sleep. You gave it to me,' the vessel tells him, and the sound of their voice inside his head fills him with longing, so deep it seeps through him. It builds like knots in his throat, spreading down in his chest and gripping around his heart. A longing that’s not even his own.
‘How long did I sleep? Where- where was I born?’
They smile and it’s gentle nostalgia, a brush of fingers in his hair. ‘We were born together, a long, long time ago. On our home-planet, but she’s no more. It’s just the two of us now. At least when you remember.’
He looks at them, the golden rim of their eyes, so familiar. ‘You’re in pain,’ He realizes.
Still, they keep on smiling; genuine, mournful. ‘I’ve been for a long time. Everytime you leave, everytime you forget,’ they say, and he looks at their hearts, beating together. It’s his heart, yet now that he sees it, he doesn’t want it back. He’s even more confused than he’s been all this time.
‘Why am I forgetting? What’s happening to me?’
‘It’s a pact. You made a pact, so we won’t lose ourselves. So we can still meet, however long it takes. But the pact is a sacrifice, it eats all your memories away, every time. And each time you sleep, you must repeat the cycle, otherwise-‘
‘Otherwise?’ 
‘ -otherwise I’ll disappear. I wasn’t meant to be alive for this long. I was meant to cease from existence a long, long time ago. But you wouldn’t let me.' They look up, but there’s no accusation in their eyes. ‘We’ve both been so selfish, this is the price we have to pay.’
These bits of their past only serve to bring more and more questions. Questions he might not want answers to. Because his heart, the one he’s abandoned, it knows. It knows the sacrifice they made, it knows who this person in front of him is. Even if he doesn’t remember them right now. 
‘I can feel you,' he tells them and as they touch, their beings vibrate solely as one. ‘Your life, pouring into mine. You exist because of me, and I exist because of you.’ Their smile is so gentle, radiant. Something he wants to keep forever. This vessel belongs to him only. 
‘I’m sorry it hurts you. I’m sorry.'
‘I think I can take it. I think- it’ll hurt worse if you’re gone.’ He doesn’t know how he knows this. It’s just a feeling, an urge. To keep them here, to never let them go, to always find them, wherever they might be in the universe.
‘I know,' they say and they're folding around him, even though they're so much smaller in comparison. He’s starting to see himself, a blurry vision of the thing he became. Something like infinity, encased inside of him. How is this small vessel able to contain him? It shouldn’t be possible and yet-
‘How long do we have?’ he asks.
‘We never know. Time doesn’t flow for us, not here.’
‘What happens if we go somewhere where it does?’
‘We can’t. I can’t… I’m sorry.’ 
They're speaking the truth. 'Then I’ll stay here with you. Until I forget again?’
‘Until you forget again.’ 
‘I’m not letting go. Not until we get out of here, however long that will take.’
‘I know. I’ll wait for you,' they promise, and their warmth floods into him, their beings spiraling against each other.
‘Are you alone? Does it hurt too bad?’ He asks them.
‘I’m not entirely alone,’ they tell him. ‘I can always feel your pain, and I’ll always seek you out.’
‘Then I’ll meet you halfway.’ He promises and they believe him.
They breathe each other's life, mold together wordlessly, effortlessly. He knows them. They are life, and life is them, his vessel. The one that contains him, the one who reflects him in every world they've lived in, in every life they’ve died. Time doesn't flow for them anymore, not here, not now, not for a long while to come. It's only space. Just their spirits, without a home, deprived of any certainty of a better reality. 
Just him and his vessel.
They exist for each other, past the rules of time, past the endless vacuum of space, past the burning of the stars and the death of life. They simply are there. He holds on with every fiber of his being, just a little longer, a little longer, please-
A little longer.
Then he forgets.
He once loved somebody.
He loved them so much, but try as he might, he can’t remember them anymore, and the only memory he has is that it hurts.

From the Vatican Archives: File M5:1-5
Posted from The Convent of Las Hermanitas de los Mansos, Sanitorium - Manta, Ecuador
From Christian Drewitt
November 17, 2010
Dearest Lyra,
Where to start? It’s been a year or more since I last wrote, my love, and I hope that this letter will explain everything. I’ve included everything into a file, they gave me everything, everything.  Now, it is clear to me that the things that have transpired have happened for a purpose by God, Himself. The good sisters of this convent where I have awoken have been kind enough to provide me with pen and paper so that I may relay to you this horrid tale. When I am returned to you, I will seal it away forever I hope. Should something arise, however, all the information related to this event can be located within these pages and you, Lyra, will bear the responsibility with which I have been cursed. 
As you know, for 27 years, I did not speak. I never bothered to learn sign language. The cure to my mutism, however, came in the form of extreme shock, deep in some remote pocket of a hot and damp South American jungle where my eyes were forced to look upon unnamable things so monstrous that I at once knew they were not of God’s good creation.  
I am not an archeologist as you were led to believe, although I work with ancient artifacts. My position at my company is to hunt and retrieve daemonic objects from the farthest reaches of the earth. There were six members of our party including myself. I am the last one alive and sane. 
Lyra, how I long to be in your arms once again. I miss you, the scent of your perfume, your laugh. Soon, we will be reunited and everything will be alright. Everything will be okay, everything will be okay. I can hear the key in my door—the nurses are returning with lunch. I will end the letter here and write you another to properly explain. 
My love forever and ever,
Christian
November 19, 2010
Dear Lyra,
My love, I am posting this letter too close to the last one, so you very likely have not even received the first news. I wanted to be sure that you knew I was alive and well first before delving into an explanation. I didn’t get a chance to make you understand, to detail the events. Of course, you will be confused when you read the first letter. I understand. It must read as the rantings of a madman, but I assure you I am very sound of mind. You know that I have always borne a strong constitution. Everything will be okay. It always is.
But I should tell you what happened. You see, someone opened the box once on land--the artifact from the ship that is.
When we reached the jungle, we were to meet a young man, Javier. He was to be our guide for the final resting place of the [REDACTED]. That’s when it all went wrong. A group of men had been following for days. They were not natives, they spoke many different languages and some even wore military uniforms. Strange people, so strange. They would chant nonsense and worship at the foot of the [REDACTED]. All at once, they set upon us and killed Javier. Poor Alec Carter was gravely injured. We escaped but Victor allowed his eyes to fall open the cursed thing and it made him strange and poisoned his mind. Not even the natives will look upon it. Dr. Phillips navigated us through the jungle. He is a sick man. The doctor died shortly after. 
Don’t you see? It all went terribly wrong. It was meant to be a simple journey. The artifact would guide us to its home and it was going to be destroyed. 
It happened like this: Victor did not destroy the [REDACTED]. Instead, he fixed it. Then, the floors shook, creatures emerged. It’s hazy here. I remember Carter shouting for me to grab the [REDACTED] and run. There were flashes of gunfire, a great and fearsome voice booming in the cave, commanding all to look at [REDACTED]. 
Everything changed then, Lyra. I was in a cave, but something incredible happened. I was in the cave but then, in an instant, I wasn't. My vision cut to a white beach. There was a Tsunami-like wave that cast a shadow. It moved in slow motion. When I looked to my right, I could see the remains of an ancient desert city. There were sounds in my ears and scents filled my head. Incense and spices and the rings of bells. To my left, beneath the great wave, there was a woman dressed in black. A long black veil covered her face except for her kohl-lined eyes. Her fingers were motioning, sparks of red flame flickered along the tips and slither between the digits and knuckles. Death is a woman, Lyra. I have seen her now. She is beautiful and inviting. I was tempted to be with her, to end everything as it was and be free of the brine-riddled cave. But then before I could decide, I returned to the jungle and there were cool fingers over my eyes and a woman’s voice in my ear. “Don’t look.” There was screaming, more gunfire. 
My sight changed again. It sharpened. Once more, I had all my faculties and I can recall grabbing the box and shutting it. Mark Kim, he was with me. We escaped. 
But Lyra, there are people at my door again. Those men always come and keep interrupting. I will never manage to fully tell you my story. Greedy, they are. Over and over, they want to discuss what I have seen. I will write another letter as soon as I am able. 
Love,
Christian
January 3, 2011
Lyra,
Why have you not returned my letters? It has been two months. Perhaps, I should be patient. I know that we are very far apart and the post will take a while to reach you in England. Things are not well, unfortunately. I believed I would improve with time but it seems that my nerves only continue to fray as my memory returns to me. Each piece only chips away at my own sanity. 
Lyra, I want to go home. Fevered visions have dominated my senses for what feels like days. Visions of cyclopean cities constructed in what appeared to be dark, wet caverns deep beneath the sea. Strange beasts swim before my eyes in that ancient grotto.
I can fully recall now how I ran and slipped against the algae covered stairs in an attempt to climb out of the pit, while my fingers clawed against the stone. There was no escape. Each corner I turned, every tunnel and staircase only revealed more of the strange civilization. I felt my sanity slip further, though it might have been a blessing in those moments. Do you understand now? I saw it!
It’s massive body breaking water over its back and leaving the seabed exposed. Its face was a mass of tentacles that twisted and wove in endless motion beneath red, glowing eyes. I could not describe its size, for the thing dwarfed any structure that you have likely seen. Oh, dear God! I shake and weep now as I recall that eldritch scene. Surely, it could not be a mere beast but a god of old. Yes. A god of old coming to exact vengeance on mankind for allowing ourselves to forget it. If God was merciful He would strike us all down rather than allowing us to continue to exist alongside these creatures.
I remember wandering through the jungle. My mind switched back and forth. When I was not lost in the ancient city, I was lost in the Amazon trailed by my final living but mad companion. I stumbled along the river, faintly aware of the weakness my body felt. The only reprieve during these torturous hours was the periodic appearance of that woman from my dream—if it was a dream. In the moments I felt my nerves become undone, she would materialize just out of reach. Death’s lips would brush the shell of my ear, fingers against my back, all gentle direction onward through the trees or upward through the labyrinth. I ran until I could no longer. From there, I found myself dragging myself along the forest floor
I lay face down in the mud only inches from the river, but could not raise my head nor make any movement toward it. It was then she appeared. She knelt by my head and dripped cool, fresh water into my open mouth with gold ringed fingers. I cannot recall her exact appearance, only the tender shape of her dark eyes. With every move, the jewelry that hung from her ears chimed against the delicate chains that were twisted into the woman’s dark hair.  She came to the end of her bucket of water, letting the liquid drip against my lips for the final time. She pressed her mouth against mine and whispered a single word, “Speak.” In an instant, she was gone and my memory of the next period in the wilderness as well. 
And that is it. I awoke in a hospital in the coastal city of Manta, Ecuador; miles away from our initial destination. Apparently, my body had been discovered by a group of fishermen on the river. I had been babbling when I was found. With me was the box that I clutched to my chest like a jealous child. I had begged anyone who had handled me not to open it. To the fishermen’s and doctors’ credit, they honored my wishes and the same bag was found beneath my cot.
Back! Those wretched men have returned. They will take away my letters again but I don't know if they will post it. Love of my life, Lyra, please. I need some assurance that you have read my letters. It will keep me going for a little while longer. 
Love,
Christian

My love,
I have received your letters, but I feel something is terribly wrong. They have all come at once, wrapped together, all opened and resealed. You said in the most recent posting that you were taking the next flight out to Manta and will be in Ecuador within the next 72 hours. It has been a week since and I am so afraid, Lyra. I want to go home. They will not let me leave the room. They have cut out much of my words, of that I am certain. You will have only read the sections of my writings that paint you a picture of a man who has lost his mind. I am sane, Lyra. To this fact, I cling desperately for it is the last thing I have in my possession.
They have taken the box from me. They will not let me see my companion and I can no longer hear him cry. Please, come to see me. 
Love,
Christian

Dear Lyra,
They tell me I am ill. Over and over, they have told me. With all these memories in my mind of the grotto, of the eldritch beast and all his caves, of the woman sent by Death--if not death herself. I want them gone. Perhaps, in order to rid myself of such things, it would be best to accept that they are ravings of a madman. I came to understand that maybe you have not visited because of my poor standing. One day, when I am returned to health, I will pack up and step out onto the street, the cobblestone street across the church. I see it every morning outside my window, the sight impeded by bars. I am tired of this small, white room. 
I would write more, but there is not much to write. The hours creep by as slowly as they did on the ship. There are days that my dreams blend into the present and I can see you standing on the street corner, waiting for me. Like right now. It is so clear, but I must remind myself that it is not so. 
There is a woman there, though. Of this, I am certain. I can see her clearly on the street corner staring at me. Veiled in black, kohl darkened eyes that I can see even from here in my room. Her earrings are tinkling against the rings on her fingers as she tangles them around and around. She has found me again. The sound, it grows close and I can smell the sea. Salt fills the air and she is at my window.

“ANIMAL RIGHTS PROTESTERS STORM GENETICS RESEARCH LAB!”
At first we all thought nothing of it. This was one of those things that happened to other people far away from us. Headlines from other worlds. Soon though, it was just harder to get things, people had to go to the next town for their shopping. No one really bothered and the news was filled with the questions of morals and animal rights groups and questions about genetics and evolution.
However, it became evident that things weren’t going to get better for a while and that eventually we would run out of ways to feed people. The locusts were swarming and there was nothing we could do, they had destroyed crops for whole countries and it would soon spread to whole continents and with their genetic modifications they adapted to climates and vegetation much quicker. Those protesters - no, terrorists wanted to watch the world die - slowly.
All across the world people were starving. Some people in their desperation had tried to catch and eat the locusts. Even if they managed to catch enough to last a week or so it just delayed the inevitable and there was nothing more we could do, everything we tried was outpaced by their ability to reproduce at speeds we’d never seen. They destroyed everything and they returned as soon as there was anything they could eat.
At first they called me a ‘doomsday prepper’ because I decided early on that I would grow some of my own food due to the shortages in the supermarkets. I had set up a small farm with a range of crops including radishes, potatoes, green beans, carrots, and spinach. I grew a couple of batches of everything and managed to perfect the timing so that I was harvesting something every week. I combined this with the huge supply of soup cans I had stocked up on and the farm supplied one meal every day and the soup made up the other. 
That ridicule from people around me soon turned to envy, as that early learning and preparation left me with a solid background by the time it really mattered. I had now created a fully sufficient indoor farm with enough crops growing in it to feed myself for the foreseeable future.
The farm was in my basement, there were no windows in there so I wired some solar panels to provide electricity just in case the raiding eventually leads to the power being cut off, and I got some grow lights so that I could minimise the risk of the locusts getting at my plants. 
Then they arrived, by that point people had begun starving weeks ago and I’d spent as much time as possible acquiring recipes online before the internet inevitably went too. We were then locked down. I boarded up my doors and windows, and all I could do was listen for the buzzing.
At first it was just the occasional buzzing as the swarm flew past on its way from field to field every few hours. The hum became the background to the sounds of death and desperation I was witnessing until the broadcasts were shut off. Finally the locusts must have realised they had eaten everything, but the sound of their tiny bodies bouncing off the windows and doors meant they must’ve been able to smell the food in my basement. The buzzing was now constant and impossibly loud.
I knew from the news before that we were some of the last places affected and that most of the world's vegetation was suffering. I had to assume that I had some of the last plants on Earth, and it was my job to protect it.
The locusts buzz was constant still, they knew I was there with more food and they were trying everything to get in.The swarm circled my house, droning as they continued to grow, and I suddenly had the horrific realisation the swarm could've been big enough by now to swallow my house. People wouldn’t be able to see it from outside the swarm, at least the boards I had put up were holding out for now though.
The problems started when it became apparent that the locusts had found an opening somewhere. I had already sealed up the basement the night before and when I woke up in the morning I had a handful of them in my house. In a panic I sprayed them with some weed killer which seemed to do the trick for now but if I didn’t find that gap then I would soon have the whole swarm in my house.
I also knew I couldn’t go into the basement until I’d plugged the gap because the risk of me letting in the locusts was too high so for the time being that was off limits, I just had to hope they hadn’t got into there too.
It took almost the whole day but eventually I found how they were getting in. One of the small gaps I had left when I wired in the solar panels was just big enough to let them through. A few hours later I was satisfied I had plugged the gap and any others that were left and settled down for the night. I decided I should wait and see if my repairs worked before I opened the door back down to my basement.
The buzz was ever present as usual and by now it was driving me insane. It never stopped, sometimes it was quieter, sometimes it was deafeningly loud but it was always there and it had to end. The question was how?
I was still nervous about the effectiveness of my repairs so I decided to set some traps for the locusts. If they somehow managed to get through the gaps again they would have to dislodge the plugs I had put in. I had wrapped the plugs in some spring that if they managed to dislodge would then pull on the trigger for the bug spray which would drench the opening until I plugged the gaps again. Hopefully, keeping them out long enough to fix the problem. 
I opened the door to my basement and was hit with the smell of earth. As I descended the stairs and found my plants exactly as I had left them, relief washed over me . I spent the day watering and tending to the plants and even expanded a bit, using an old surfboard as a makeshift shelf to accommodate the extra plants.
The next morning disaster struck. I was checking on the traps I set in the morning and suddenly the power went out. The locusts must have blocked the light and my solar panels reserve was all used up. I tried to think back to when I had wired the solar panels into the house before to think of a solution to this nightmare but I was struggling to come up with anything.
It took me almost the whole day but then I got it. My water still worked, it came from an underwater reserve about a mile away and I was the only person still using it, as far as I knew. I could create a small hydropower turbine and run my bath tap over it. It might only power one lamp but that's all I needed. So over the next few days I feverishly worked to set up the power and finally I got it ready for a trial run. I ran the tap and waited, and waited, and finally the lamp came on. Yes! My farm was going to survive. 
I spent most of the next few days tending to my farm and working on a plan to get rid of the incessant racket outside. It was good to know that my repairs had worked because the locusts were staying outside my house and that, for now, nothing had changed.
Over the course of the following days/weeks the monotony of everything meant I lost track of the time as they passed every day merging into the next. It didn’t help that my clock had stopped weeks ago, and now when keeping time seemed important I had no way to do so. 
In the morning I woke up with a strange feeling in my gut. Something was missing. I listened at the door for the buzzing …Nothing. I guess they’d maybe gone for a bit. I busied myself with my usual tasks and waited for the droning to return. Eventually it was getting dark and the buzz was still gone so I decided I’d wait till the morning to see if it comes back.
The next morning came and there was still no whirring. I struggled to sleep in the silence and spent most of the night tossing and turning, trying to make sense of the sudden lack of humming. The locusts can't have gone, surely?
I stood for almost an hour with my hand on the door handle, getting the boards off had been the easy part but opening the door had me frozen. How long had it been? 6 days? 6 weeks? I can’t remember any more. Now all I had to do was open the door and hope that there was nothing on the other side.
I turned the key in the lock, the click was piercing after becoming so used to just the noise of the the silence of the last day. I felt my heart beating and my hands were slick with sweat as I turned the handle. This was it, if they’re still outside then I’ll be killed in the swarm as it rushes in and they’ll eat what’s left of my food, nothing will survive. If I had got this wrong, if they were still there, I was fucked.
I gently pushed the door. No dice, the door didn’t move. That was strange, it was never that stiff before.
I pushed against the door harder. This time it opened, just a crack. Fresh air flooded into the room. That first breath was intoxicating, having spent so long inside I forgot now that I missed the crisp air, and yet something was off. Had the fresh air always smelt like that? I forced the door hard in a desperate attempt to escape my home-turned-prison but it was putting up a fight.
The door groaned and splintered, and in the end the gap in the door was just wide enough for me to fit through. I recoiled in shock at what I saw. They were everywhere. The sea of locusts had died, I guess from starvation, trying unsuccessfully to get into my house. They lay in piles around my house, like dunes of sand, under the windows and at my door. I raced upstairs to get a better view of the mounds of dead bugs below and tore down the boards off the windows. The view from every single one was the same, a sea of death. Hundreds of thousands of locusts in shades of green and yellow piled up against the doors and windows and spread away from the house in a desperate attempt at finding food elsewhere.
Now what? They were gone but so was everyone and everything else. The world suddenly felt very, very, big and I was feeling very, very, small. 
Over the following months I began to clear up the locust. Cleaning took much longer than I thought, even just the pile under my door took a whole week to clear. As time went on though I eventually managed to clear out a section to grow my crops outside. I made use of the locusts by clearing them slowly into a sort of compost for my crops. I even tore the traps down eventually although I could never bring myself to move the whole farm outside again so as I expanded I kept a small farm inside too. Just in case the locusts ever came back again.
Now all I had left to do was what I had always done, survive. Survive and hope that there were other survivors out there who would reach me one day.

“Welcome to your service of remembrance! I’m Kazuo, and it will be my pleasure to guide you through the process as you consider the various options extended to you by NeuroNon. Your presence here confirms the clarity of your life priorities. We believe that life is made of moments, not minutes, and capturing and retaining those moments that you want to savor is what we’re here for. With over a decade of public service and another fifteen in the private sector, we are the world’s first and oldest in the field. You’ve obviously discerned that some of the moments we live through are of no more value than yesterday’s kitchen garbage, and NeuroNon is here to proverbially take out the trash. As Montaigne put it, nothing fixes a thing so firmly in the memory as the wish to forget it. 
I see, um, it’s not my intention to make you uncomfortable. You will not have to discuss the subject matter at issue with me. Only two people will be privy to your private interview, and confidentiality is critical to our company’s existence. Your reviewers will explore the precise details of what you want to leave behind, not to be invasive, but merely to make sure the specific contents are isolated without the interruption of your essential cognitive networks. They will be most gracious and very discreet. I think you’ll be deeply satisfied with….
You’re curious about the tank? Aplysia californica. Sea slugs found on the West Coast. They’re not the most photogenic, are they? But they’ve become immortalized in the NeuroNon narrative. That was the first species in which we successfully transplanted memory from one organism to another. mRNA transferral. A snail that had never been exposed to electric shock recoiled as though she had been after receiving the mRNA of a snail that had. It remembered someone else’s memory.
Yes, it’s amusing, isn’t it? Amazing? I agree!
Next, we replicated the process by manipulating sensory nerve cells in a petri dish…but perhaps this is more technical than interests you. Yes? The technique. Of course.
Come, let’s walk. I’ll give you a tour. Through this door and down the hall.
Memories can never actually be erased. There’s no camera flash on a stick that we wave in front of your face and make them disappear in an instant. It’s a bit more, if I can be casual, like hiding a candle in the sunlight. The candle is still there, you just don’t notice it. And if you intend to ignore it, it’s quite easy to do so. So we take a triggering image of bad memories and surround it in…a sort of…mental white noise. When a client encounters the triggering image, or sound, or any other sensory stimuli, the hippocampus, in which we implant modified neurons, recalls a vague scene or ambiance - a landscape, for instance, or the sound of waves in the distance. Anytime the client’s memory strays close to the cleansed memory, the more pleasant scene surrounds and overwhelms it. The experience, after decades of refinement in our labs, is very peaceful.
I’m glad for how quickly you understand. You’ve obviously come from a pedigree education, am I right? Of course. It shows. If I may speak personally, as a former client myself, it’s exquisite to be able to dwell only in the isolated recollections for which we have labored and excelled through our lives, free from unwanted and undeserved mental debris. It’s an internal utopia.
Glass of wine while we walk? Madison, could you provide for our guest?
You’re correct. But the confidential nature of our work is not because we have anything to hide. Rather, we mean to protect those who have sought to leave the past behind. You can imagine that certain elements would meddle indiscriminately - social activists opposed to our vision. But at this stage, given your downpayment and paperwork we’ve already put you through, you’re free to ask anything you like. I’m an open book.
Yes, our story is a fascinating one. I hope perhaps, in time, the files can be opened so that the worldwide public can marvel at how we arrived here. Perhaps some history is in order.
The first real success was a horrible case - horrible before we cleansed her. She was a victim of kidnapping, locked in a basement, and brutalized for three years, if you can imagine. She was reduced to a panicked recluse, beyond the reach of psychiatry, likely to remain institutionalized and further regressing. When we completed our work with her, she was transformed. It was all gone, a blank slate. She was on her feet again. She was our evolutionary Lucy, the one who put us upright.
That’s a fair question, and I’ll be honest with you. There were glitches. We’ve completely eliminated them, but there were a few originally. The clinical trials were long and slow, of necessity. In Phase One, there was a bank manager who had witnessed a murder during a robbery, a teller blown to bits with a shotgun, and in the process of righting his mind, we lost the bank safe’s combination. Relatively harmless, but a warning marker for us. Then one a bit worse, a woman who weighed over 800 lbs. She was, for obvious health reasons, dangerously close to terminal. In the process of eliminating some of her memories tied to dietary norms and impulses, we insufficiently distinguished that which was to be preserved from the rest of her cognitive networks, and afterwards, she had forgotten how to eat a banana. Random, yes? She could never relearn it. She would just sit and puzzle over the things. Harmless, I guess, but a mistake. And a few other things with her, but she is alive today because of NeuroNon.
I do want to suggest, if I can pause for a moment, that you consider the optional promotional levels. They have less to do with the final product and more to do with aesthetics. Premium service is well worth the investment. While the Basic service will deliver the same ultimate result, it’s a bit like privileged airline classes - either one will get you there, but one is a bit more luxurious. But as you’ve already realized that the value of the result is worth the investment of a lifetime, the difference is inconsequential.
No, there are no glitches today. Good question. The last one was…um…hmm. I can’t seem to place it. I’ll have someone look that up for us in a bit. Huh. Funny, I can’t…. Well, we’ll look it up in due time.
Through these doors, you’re in luck. Someone is going through the process as we speak and has consented to onlookers through a glass wall. You can see…ah, they’re right in the middle of the surgery. You’re not offended are you? You see that the hole in the side of the skull is relatively small, only about the size of a quarter. Laparoscopic insertion from there. We no longer remove the skullcap like in the early days. And the external NeuroNon disc on the surface can be veiled completely through a graft of skin and hair, or, as we’re finding is increasingly popular, left in plain sight for, well, I guess one would say, bragging rights. Just look. The wetware, you see through the hole. Not really vulgar is it - not much different than the snails. Yet so versatile. It’s a universe in there.
Back to my history-telling, though. There was one case that forced our hand in terms of availability, though. If Lucy showed the scientific and medical communities that it was an invaluable, ethical contribution to human betterment, this was the dark parallel: the customer who sues for millions after spilling her own coffee in her own lap. Of course you’ve heard the public version of this story. A woman sued us for the right to access the technology so that she could forget her ex-husband. It is a bit funny, I guess. But sad. We probably could have warded her off if the Catholic Church hadn’t embraced her, calling it “God’s view of annulment,” as you’ve heard. So for short relationships and midnight Las Vegas chapel weddings, you know, where there is no vast network of connections which would be lost, so the story itself can be isolated from the rest of the client’s history, it can be done. The public doesn’t realize how much this has driven the expansion of our work. Husbands who can’t endure their midnight angst who end up buying their wives what they call a “second virginity” as an anniversary gift, erasing one of her old flings whom they - the husband, I mean - can’t get over. Thomas Edison was miffed when the phonograph was used for entertainment, for music, because he wanted it to record only important speeches and historical events. I guess we can’t complain when the medical miracle that cures trauma is primarily funded by jealousy and insecurity.
That to say, our reasons for acceptance of new clients are much broader than they were at first.
And of course, that led to a flurry of lawsuits. Every student who had been triggered by a bad grade and was now too anxious for job interviews, non-medaling Olympians wallowing in depression, ex-prisoners as well as ex-officers, deprogrammed cult members and reformed sinners - everyone who had gone down a wrong path who now wanted a clean slate. Ex-junkies and even just cold-turkey-quitting ex-smokers. Anyone who could pull together a reason and a bank account was ready to insist that this was a medical necessity. Civil rights groups got involved, and a potentially methodical future rapidly became a less than well-prepared present.
Of course, the cultural milieu was ripe for it. Statues were being torn down and the names of schools were being changed. Textbooks were being rewritten to give a smaller role to religion and a larger one to race. There was even a movement at one point, now dissolved, seeking to fund the service as a kind of racial reparations, to eradicate racist trauma retrospectively. We didn’t see forgetfulness as negligence, we saw it as our absolution. It was our baptism - washing off the old so that we could be free for new life. 
No one with a good memory has a clean conscience.
You hear that I’m not telling you that you have to see it this way. It’s simply the way many have come to see it.
A…nuance, I’d say, not a problem…is that when the desires of the masses correspond to the desires of the elite, no one notices the disparity of motives. Our largest current influx is employers willing to fund the service for employees who wanted it in lieu of legal liability. It was written into their contracts. Instead of arbitration, the offense is erased by mutual consent, and thus settled out of court. When microtraumas are catalogued and litigated, it’s simply the most cost-effective way.
Imagine, one day, being able to pluck individual memories from the mind like we pluck a hair from the head - a single, isolated memory that we would be better without.
Sorry, I see from the glint in your eye I’ve stepped back on my soapbox. You’ll have to excuse me. I’m very passionate about this. It’s my life’s work. It saved me as well, after all. I don’t mean to be controversial of course. This is just history.
If you’ll walk with me into the next room, I’ll show you where you would undergo the procedure. Here it is. The room will be redesigned to your specifications for your comfort. You’ll want to bring keepsakes and pictures tied to healthy memories on which you will concentrate when you awaken. But I can show you the equipment, nonetheless. This is the chair.
Where was I?
The lawsuits. Yes. Like a swarm of wasps.
That then required some flexibility to prevent it all from shutting down. That’s when the billionaires turned from space exploration to memory. Facebook produced “Nevermind” and Alibaba, “Wangji.” And of course, that quickly led to government regulation.
Of course, the federal government had been using the process for a decade before the public was even aware of its existence. In addition to trauma resolution, it served a remarkable role in counterterrorism. The most notable success was a captured operative whose memories of his training they distorted. He awakened to find himself in a penthouse with full maid service, surrounded by apparent CIA staff who told him that he was one of them. They needed everything he had picked up on a tour of duty, and they told him - see the irony here - that the enemy had wiped parts of his memory. What could he recall nonetheless? Quite a good deal, it turned out. Enough. And that’s actually how we got bin Laden. It’s true. The details will never be released in our lifetimes, and I cannot substantiate it for you as anything more than hearsay, but that’s what happened. As I say, I hope for a day when the files are opened and the world can see the revolutionary value this service has provided.
There was no inhibition to its use behind the scenes after that. This was to be the way of the future, the way of a new world order. We have no idea how many people the military put through it, or how many variations of its use they’ve explored.
Yes, we’re a private company. You ask that because…? Yes, it began as a military operation, but…. Sorry, I’m not sure. I see what you’re asking, yes. Somewhere along the lines our privacy was ensured, though, so governmental regulation didn’t result in government control. I’m…a bit fuzzy on that one. Funny…. Anyway, it’s completely private now.
The government wasn’t seeking to limit it; I guess that explains it. To make the service widely available required widespread manipulation of mRNA, achieving preparation in subjects prior to the necessity of the procedure. Someone who is brought in after a car accident who has already received mRNA transference by injection is easily treated before they even regain consciousness, presuming the necessary waivers have been processed. While the patient recuperates, NeuroNon simply isolates specific neurons and creates our mental white noise around the timeframe of the accident. The patient awakens undisturbed, good as new.
Of course we can’t ethically prevent them from insisting upon it. If someone doesn’t wish to awaken traumatized, who are we to insist that they must? 
That’s how the mRNA injections came to be so widely distributed. Californians voted for it and Texans mandated it. It enjoyed more support than any legislation since we eliminated Daylight Savings Time. Nearly the entire public is ready to walk in at any moment and be cleansed.
I’ve gone on too long now. I’m sure you have questions. Yes? Correct, we are a private company, free from federal interference. Yes, they support our work. Financially as well, yes. No, your records are kept private. How? Well…I’m sorry, ask me again? Sorry, perhaps I can review our records on that matter in my office. Rest assured, it’s secure.
So, during the procedure, you would sit in this chair. Because neurological stimulation can provoke kinetic responses, we do strap you to the chair. Wouldn’t want fingers flying around when there’s direct access to the wetware, would we? The wall in front of you is completely digital, and through it we would run either self-produced video images or stock footage of your choosing, something pleasant and tied to a context of the most happy moments of your life. You can bring tactile and olfactory tokens with you - plush toys, a loved one’s shirt. One gentleman simply brought a slice of pecan pie of his grandmother’s recipe. Whatever you want.
Would you like to sit down in the chair to see how it feels? There you go. It’s comfortable, isn’t it? Just a preface to the comfort you will have once the baggage of a lifetime is buried in warm, mental sunlight. The process is basically guaranteed. If anything were to go wrong, we could simply repeat the process and hide even your memory of being here. We could do it again and again, and you would never remember it. Funny, isn’t it?
So, are you ready to begin?"

“Things are never gonna be the same now...” 
He said as he leaned against the banister, trusting it with all his weight, perhaps even what weighed on his mind. He was wearing a thick black parka, the one I’d gotten him a few years ago. I wondered for a moment why he didn’t offer it to me. 
Ponderosa pines sprinkled the white blanket of snow that lay still on the ground, almost like plastic. We stood on the wooden porch together, little splinters of wood shooting up between the planks that made up the balcony beneath us. I inched closer to him, balancing on the balls of my feet which caused inconsistent creaks to reverberate throughout the quiet of the night,
“Don’t come any closer goddammit.” 
He thrust his left hand out towards me, stopping me in my tracks. His right hand pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes shut tight. His voice was coarse, like he’d been drinking, or smoking, or both,
“I don't..understand.” I finally said, the words feeling thick in my mouth, like I had just been woken up from a nap taken in the morning only to wake up in the middle of the night. 
Swallows cooed atop their nests, everything dark but us, the yellow light from inside the cabin glowing our silhouettes which melted into shadows on the ground. He laughed maniacally, turning to face me with a forced smile, 
“Of course you don’t..of course..” The wind picked up, blowing through his unkempt hair, still brown, but longer than the last time I’d seen him. He was medium sized, undistinguished, and successfully stubborn, but his eyes were valiant, green, and piercing right through me. And yet, they were afraid. 
“You’re not even her, what would you know? Jesus..you’re not even human.” He threw his hands up in the air and slammed them back down on his jeans. He always had a habit of gesticulating. Having a private conversation with himself, he fished out a cigarette and lighter from his pocket,  “They didn’t tell me it was gonna be like this..they said it would be realistic, like how she would want to look..” He mumbled through his now lit cigarette, lighting up his face for a moment before all I could see was a trail of smoke escaping into the wind, behind him, 
“What are you talking about? I’m me, I’m here.” I smiled and took another step forward, still feeling a thousand feet away from him. 
Dropping the lighter, I could tell he had his head in the palms of his hands, and I could tell by the way his shoulders began to shake, that he was crying. I could just barely see a long scar on the side of his face; I wondered where it came from. Without hesitation, I nearly threw myself on top of him, wrapping my arms around his frame and holding him tightly, hearing his heartbeat even through layers of cloth. Why couldn’t I feel his warmth? 
Almost immediately, he pried me off,
“Get away from me! Stop trying to convince me that you’re my wife! You may sound just like her, but you sure as hell don’t look like her..” He shouted, throwing me to the side in a fruitless attempt to rid himself of my presence. Successfully, I caught myself on the banister, but not without tearing my skin on a rusty nail that stuck haphazardly out of the wood. He never wanted to renovate the place, always obsessing over that ‘vintage 2000s look’. I gasped,
“Dammit Damon look what you just made me-” I cut myself off. What is this? 
He finally looked at me, tears freezing onto his face, his nose red.
Why am I not cold? I looked at my hand, waiting for blood to trickle down the gash the nail had just made,  “Damon..why am I not bleeding?” I looked up manically, but his eyes looked just as afraid as mine. 
Beneath the gash, was not blood and muscle, but gears, and steel, and tiny colorful wires that glowed iridescently, blinking a bright red, before slowly repairing the gash like a printer, like a machine.. 
“Damon, what’s going on?” I stumbled, feeling at my flesh, scratching harder and harder, never before in my life had I wished so much for my body to bleed.
Damon’s voice broke, “You mean..you don’t know?” I moved towards him, and it was only then I realized that faintly, with the movement of my limbs, could a mechanical, unconscious sound be heard, ticking like a clock through my body, if you could even call it that. I robotically walked inside to the golden glow of our kitchen, his eyes following me but his feet sticking firm. My gaze trailed to ads littered around the living room, paired with beer bottles and photo albums that lay scattered on the floor. By the time I settled all the noise in my head from a scream to a low hum, my breath was torn from my lungs after reading the first headlines I could find,
“Revive your loved ones with groundbreaking AI neural transplants!” They read. 
“Neuro..brain transplants..” I muttered to myself as I traced the bold inked letters with my fingers. For some reason newspapers were still being published, I guess the world has a liking for things that should be left behind. 
“Left behind..” I muttered again, slowly looking at our family portrait which stood propped up and unassuming on the kitchen table, a thick layer of dust settling on the glass. I had always cleaned it every week, so why was it so…Damon slowly walked through the glass door, shutting it behind him softly. His movements were stiff and soft. Hesitantly, he spoke, “What was the name of our unborn child?” As if he didn’t want me to actually give an answer, maybe hoping that he’d be right. He always had to be right. 
“Avery.” I said just as softly, afraid that maybe I would in fact not know, and he would be right this whole time, “We have a son named Alec, we got married on November 11th, we went to Spain for our honeymoon, and you’ve secretly always wished I had brown hair cause it reminds you of your first girlfriend! Is that enough for you Damon? And..close the door before you let the cold air in, even though it wouldn’t even matter to me would it?” 
I can't even begin to describe what his face looked like. It seemed like he was conflicted between feeling fear and love, and both of those things can’t coincide it seems, because if they did, then they would’ve just let me die wouldn’t they? I still couldn’t come up with how that scar got there. 
Thoughts and memories swarmed my head as I made my way up the stairs, to my mirror, to the last piece of evidence that would prove I am what he thinks I am. Proof that this isn’t some big prank, some caught on camera TV show of all things. The mirror was dusty, but with one swipe of my thumb which didn’t even feel like mine anymore, everything suddenly clicked. 
I stared at myself for a long time. I didn’t move, and I didn’t say anything. All I heard were Damon’s footsteps which hurriedly followed behind me. I looked like myself, yes, faintly. I had blond hair that cascaded down in front of my chest, and my height was the same. I know that, because Damon always had to crane down slightly to kiss me, and my clothes were the same, the black dress I wore to every party which now covered a body I couldn’t recognize. My skin was smooth like silicone, but hard, like steel, and my eyes were blue, but they looked like a doll's, only trying to imitate what it’s like to look human. A doll. I laughed,“They forgot the birthmark on my cheek you know.” Damon’s breathless frame stared back at me through the mirror’s reflection, “They forgot a lot of things actually Damon...the people who did this to me, the scientists or whatever...they forgot my freckles, and my muscles...my eyes-” He cut me off, “Elodie..is it really you?” That was the first time I had heard my name escape his lips in so long, I was asleep for such a long time after all apparently. 
I could do nothing but collapse to the floor, staring down at my hands, which now no longer had a scar on them, or a writer’s bump, or anything, but past them on the carpet, were faded out blotches of something..maybe wine? Nevermind that. Inside, I was screaming, if there was a way to kill myself I would’ve, but the thing was, the very definition of what it meant to be alive was challenged in that moment, “Why did you do this to me.” I said, staring right through him. He choked, leaning on the frame of our bedroom door for support. He was strong, but he was shaking, and he was crying...at least he could still do that. 
A small, quiet voice spoke up from the darkness behind him,  “Mom? Are you back?” My eyes met the little boy whose eyes resembled my old ones, and I cried. There were no tears, but I tried, and I sat there and wailed as Damon slowly approached the mirror and turned it the opposite way. He’s always been thoughtful. What does it mean to be human? I thought as a blinking red glowed in the corner of my eye, signifying I was low on power.
I looked up to the man I married for support, assuming he saw me as his spouse again, but something in him was different, something grim and calculating. His eyes darted back and forth, his complexion pale as I played with the ruffles of the stained carpet. The man who brought me back to life was hiding something, and I knew it had to do with the scar on his neck and the blood on the carpet, and perhaps even the reason I died in the first place. But as I began to contemplate with the eyes of a robot and the mind of a human, my vision grew blurry, with a dark blinking red haze filtering through my vision. My arms fell limp to my side, my head lolling backward before I could say a word. Damon’s eyes couldn’t have looked through me with more fear as I lost power to myself and my own actions. As I faded into oblivion, waiting to be charged up again, I wondered if I ever would; and by the look of his eyes I was filled with immeasurable terror at a man who couldn’t decide if he wanted to kill his wife again or not.

The hero will win. The villain will lose. Someone you love will die. That’s the story. That’s always the story. Don’t forget.
Danny remembers every detail of that day. She can’t forget and, believe me, she’s tried. She remembers the electric spark of his touch. She remembers his smell—sandalwood and citrus. She remembers the way he said her name, as if he could taste it. Dark chocolate. Dry red wine. A last kiss. Delightful. Full of delight. It’s been a long twenty years, but Danny hasn’t forgotten.
They met just before sunset, at a hole-in-the-wall cafe a few blocks from Hugo’s townhouse—Danny’s choice. When she arrived, she found Shifan Noble already waiting for her, smiling at the assembled paparazzi, as his aides fielded questions. A chunky, middle-aged photographer in square glasses noticed her and screamed for the ‘Silverswift’ to smile. Obediently, Danny twisted up the corners of her mouth, watched Noble’s head tilt towards her, watched his face soften into something like compassion. Something like pity.
Danny ducked into the café. A few seconds later, the tech-entrepreneur-activist-genius with the million-dollar smolder walked through the door. “Danika DeRioux?” Noble extended a hand, which Danny accepted without thought. Hugo probably would have killed her for that. He had warned her.
“I know Prof says there are rules, but they’re Hero rules. Not following them is chapter one in the Villainous Handbook for Villainy. Don’t let him touch you. No going off script. No unnecessary risks. Promise me?”
“I’m a Superhero TM, Hugo. Taking unnecessary risks is in my contract. Subsection 4.c.iii.”
“This isn’t funny, Beth!”
“Note my lack of jocundity. And it’s Danika, Hugo. Danika DeRioux. Beth didn’t play well in focus groups. Plus, the alliteration pays dividends, if I’m renewed for a second season.”
Danika and Noble sat by the window, on display for the teeming paparazzi congregated across the street. Some scrawny intern wearing an entirely useless bulletproof vest served them drinks, and Shifan raised his cup in a silent toast. They studied each other for several minutes in comfortable silence. Impressed despite herself, Danny admired the tailored charcoal suit, the expensive cologne, the seemingly untidy sweep of Noble’s wavy black hair. Understated, yet impactful. Then her gaze snagged on Noble’s ring, and her snort of laughter broke the spell.
Noble raised an eyebrow, following Danny’s stare to the gold band. “Too much?”
“You have good people,” Danny smirked. “The number of brand managers and stylists who still consider silver-topped canes, goatees, and monocles acceptable Villain fashion choices is astonishing. Too bad about the cryptic Latin motto. You were almost perfect.”
Noble chuckled, holding up his hand and rotating the ring so Danny could read the script. “Small victories, Danika. I fought them on the leather gloves and maniacal laugh. The ring was a small concession.”
“Do you know what it means?”
“Mundus vult decepi, ergo decipiatur? It means ‘look at how wealthy, confident, and eccentric I am, having a personal Latin motto.’” Shifan tossed back his head, draining the last of his coffee. “This is good.”
Danny sipped at her own drink. “They add cardamom or ginger, sometimes. Or lavender.”
“Star anise, I believe.”
“Different spices,” Danny agreed. Hugo and Arthur had brought her here, back in the bad old days, back in the beginning. It had seemed as good a place as any for an ending.
“I appreciate the choice of venue,” Noble said, as if reading her thoughts. I believe most of your graduating class opted for the standard abandoned warehouse or barren cliffside meeting. My team has been scoping out ruined castles for weeks now.”
“It’s a meeting of arch nemeses, Shifan. The drama’s built in. I didn’t think we needed extra scenery.”
Noble clutched at his heart in mock offense. “Nemeses? Surely, nothing so gauche as that. Arranged feuds are like arranged marriages – far more pleasant if both parties can come to an understanding.”
Danny laughed mirthlessly. “I know I’m new to the game, but I thought the point of this arrangement was to kill each other in as entertaining and profitable a way as possible. What other sort of understanding could we possibly reach?”
Noble tilted his head. “Honesty. Perhaps even a degree of mutual respect. Relationships are hard, Danika. If we want this one to last, and it works out well for both of us if it does, then we’ll need to put some effort in. I can’t have you throwing in the towel after the first high casualty bombing or family funeral.”
Noble’s tongue lingered on the word ‘family,’ and Danny grinned. There it was—her real superpower. There was no family. No cadre of spunky, vulnerable friends. No lovers. No vulnerabilities. There was only Hugo—well, plus Arthur and Martin now—and their identities were locked up tight in an impenetrable fortress of contract law, non-disclosure agreements, and privacy clauses. She’d made a deal with the puppet-master, and, like a good little marionette, she’d put on her strings.
“I’m touched by your concern, Shifan, but I’m not going anywhere. I’ve signed the papers, bought the funny clothes, chosen the alliterative pseudonym. I’m in.”
“Yes,” Noble agreed. “You’re in. And that’s the big mystery around town. I won’t pretend, even I was shocked at your abrupt change of employment. You did well as an independent. Why take a contract with your Professor now?”
Danny shrugged. “Pick your explanation. They’re all more or less true enough. Independents are getting pushed out of the market. Insurance rates were burying me. Prof offered a killer benefits package. I wanted to meet Oprah.”
“Why, I do believe you’re lying, Danika DeRioux.” Shifan’s voice had softened. His amber-ringed black eyes were gentler now, kind, and just a little sad.
Danny bared her teeth. “Isn’t that part of the game?”
“We’re not talking about the game yet, Danika. We’re talking about relationships. For three years you stay out of the arena. No corporate sponsorships, no contractual obligations, no branding. You turn down every Villain who offers to meet. Nero. The Grey Dragon. Kalaxes. Just good, old-fashioned hero work. Now, you’re worth three quarters of a million and slated to rise by 34% in the next two years. Now you’re here, drinking cardamom coffee with me, with your shiny new logo and a top-tier P.R. firm handing out bonuses based off your name. What happened? Why are you here?”
“Why are you here, Shifan?” Danny snapped, irritated and inexplicably frightened. “You’re front-page news. Everybody in the industry wants to fight you, fuck you, or photograph you. Why did you agree to pair with a novice with limited training, no public image, a thoroughly mundane backstory, no—"
In one languorous motion, Noble reached out and placed his fingertip on the back of her hand. Danny jolted, then shivered at the touch. Danger, Hugo’s voice screamed inside her head. Red fucking warning, Beth.  
The pain approached cautiously, almost coquettishly, nuzzling at her fingers, dancing up her arm. Danny stared at her skin, half horrified, half enchanted. Behind the pain, cold numbness gripped her flesh, deadening every sensation. There was no bruising, no scarring, no sign of the agonizing death pooling in her wrists, surging up to her elbows.
"I could go further," Noble murmured, in a voice laced with hoarfrost. "Nerve to nerve. Muscle to muscle. Bone to bone. Paralyze your lungs. Seize your heart. We could end it here, Beth, if that’s what you want. If that’s why you’re here. Someone out there—perhaps the person who convinced you to take this contract—would get a big insurance payout. There would be a T.V. special, maybe even a movie. The world loves a tragedy, and they’ll pay well to watch it. I can end the story now, if you ask me. If you beg.”
Hugo would have stopped her. Hugo would have dragged her out of the coffee shop, ranted at her, pleaded with her. Hugo might have saved her. A thousand times over, Hugo might have saved her.
“No,” Danny whispered, closing her eyes as the ache twisted over her shoulders and looped around her neck. “You couldn’t.” Her eyes snapped open—twin pools of liquid mercury—bright and lifeless as moons. The veins in her wrist and palm silvered, as if her blood had hardened into steel. A shimmering glow danced across her knuckles, coating her arm in argent armor. Moon-dipped hand. Starlit fingertips. Shifan jerked back his hand, clutching the newly bleached fingertip against his chest.
“Magnificent,” Noble breathed, gazing at the glowing creature in front of him. “You are magnificent.”
Danika signed, and the silver slipped away, dissolving into her skin like melting snowflakes. “Satisfied?”
Noble smiled. “Very. You asked me why I chose you, why I wanted to meet you. This is it. I wanted to meet the Silverswift.”
“You wanted to see me, as I am,” Danika whispered, turning her head to gaze at the paparazzi and news crews. “I suppose that’s why I’m here too. I guess it’s as good a reason as any. I needed to know that one part of this ridiculous game was real. I needed to see my enemy’s face. Just the once. Just for a moment.” 
Shifan stood, slipped off the ring, and placed it gently on the table by Danny’s empty coffee cup. For a moment, his fingers hovered over Danny’s wrist, as if he could still feel the power emanating from beneath her skin.
“If you think you’ve seen your enemy’s face here, Danika DeRioux, then I pity you, and I pity those you love.” 
“Hugo, Arthur, I’m alive!” Danny howled a few hours later, bursting through the door and speeding directly for the dining room bar. She wanted something strong, something to banish the memory of Shifan Noble’s touch from her mind. “I have ten thousand things to tell you, but I’ll need to be pretty hammered first. Prof was right, by the way. Noble does have some sort of freaky muscular telekinesis or whatever that he’s keeping private. He touched my hand and, literally, my whole arm went numb. Other than that, he seems relatively stable in an evil sort of way. How did Martin’s appointment go? Wha—”
Someone had cleaned. Usually, Hugo’s books littered every surface, and souvenirs from Arthur’s anthropological research trips cluttered the stairwell and hallways. Usually, the house smelled of Thai food and strong coffee. Not anymore. Someone had organized the books, hung up the ceremonial masks, arranged the jade figurines, dusted the hand-carved menageries. There was no mess or signs of a struggle. No extra scenery. Nothing.
Just the two lifeless bodies and the horrible absence that had been Danny’s whole life.
It might have been seconds, or minutes, or hours. Danny didn’t know. Time had become some stretched, dismembered thing, dissolved from a melody into a cacophony of disjointed notes. And she was listening, listening as hard as she could, listening harder than she’d ever listened in her life and dreading what she knew she would never hear again.
“Silverswift?” Prof’s voice cut through the haze, lightning through fog. “Danika, I thought you were…I didn’t…I’m so sorry you had to find out this way. Noble just put through the paperwork. I came as soon as I could.”
“Where’s Martin?” Danny muttered, her fingertips shining as bright and lifeless as moonlight.
“Who?”
“H—they just adopted a little boy. His name’s Martin. He had a doctor’s appointment today. Arthur thinks it’s just colic.” Danny pointed to the sofa, and the soft grey elephant toy seated in one corner. “That’s his elephant.”
“The baby? Of course. Noble put in the paperwork for him too, I’m afraid. I’ve been dealing with it. It’s why I’m late. Noble took the body to St. Patrick’s. He sent a note with his…condolences.”
That was when Danny heard it. For the first time in seconds or minutes or hours, Danny heard the silence.
Silent as a wraith, Danny flung out her hands. Windows shattered. Walls shuddered and buckled. A shock wave reverberated through the house, breaking and crushing and destroying. Furniture crashed around her. Cracks snaked across the ceiling, coating the room in a thin layer of plaster. Danny turned, her face frozen into a flawless, silver mask. Even her eyes had hardened and mirrored, like shutters closed on an abandoned home. Pressing slightly with her foot, she levitated into the air. A whirlwind of silver and grey sparks twisted around her feet and hands, encircling her like chains. A silver sheen wrapped around her shoulders, then unfurled into a pair of shimmering, numinous wings.
That was it. That was the night. Danny DeRioux had been around for a few months, and Beth for twenty-six years. But that was the start of the story. That was the night the Silverswift was born.
Have you forgotten how the story goes, Prof? Danny did. It doesn’t matter. It’s almost time for the story to end anyway. That poison you took replicates Shifan’s powers almost perfectly. Your major organs are already shutting down. It might reach your lungs next. Or your liver. Or your heart, if you’ve got one.
It’s been a long twenty years. Thanks to you, Silverswift is one of the highest-grossing female Heroes in the industry. Not bad for a no-name independent. She's fought just about everyone and everything. Villains with powers, Villains with brains, Villains with money. Nero. The Grey Dragon. Kalaxes. Most of them are dead now. Even Shifan Noble is dead. Danny did that, just a few months ago, on some no name island in the South Pacific. Not that it mattered. Not anymore. Shifan got his vengeance too, in the end, even if he didn’t live to see it. He sent Danny a letter, delivered after his funeral, telling her all about the twenty years she’d missed. All about me.
Whatever else he was, Shifan Noble was a genius. A genius with millions of dollars to pour into tracking down the stories, hunting for myths, following a trial of local legends about an American woman who could appear out of thin and kill with a word. He found you, Prof. As clever as you are, Shifan Noble found you. And then, he found me. Mostly alive, hidden on the other side of the world, entrusted to one of those convenient little friends you keep at the bottom of dark holes.
It's been a long twenty years for me too, and I’ve had a lot of time to think. I think I understand your plan, now. Words and stories—that’s always been your power, Prof. It’s how you killed Beth. It’s how you killed my parents. It’s how you knew I would make such an excellent story, a really killer plot twist. That’s it, isn’t it? You wanted to bring me back on stage—broken, berserk, ready to destroy? I can see the headlines. Martin Meyers Murders Silverswift. Citizens Mourn. What do you know—sometimes the alliteration works out all by itself.
I’ve got to hand it to you. I was a masterful piece of branding—the tragic backstory of Danika DeRioux. That’s what you made me. That’s what I became. I’m sandalwood and citrus and the elephant buried beneath a lifetime of deception. I’m the nightmare day the Silverswift can’t forget.
She sends her love, by the way. She wanted me to tell you it was Noble’s stupid ring that first roused her suspicions about you. Mundus vult decepi, ergo decipiatur? It wasn’t Shifan’s motto, was it? It was yours. The world wishes to be deceived, so let it be deceived. Very funny. Very clever. Such a shame—you were almost perfect.
Would you like to know how the story ends? The hero wins. The villain loses. Someone I hate will die. That’s the story. That’s always the story. Don’t forget. 
<|endoftext|>
I remember green trees. To be specific, not just green trees, but trees in a myriad of colors. Autumn brought leaves of red, purple, and a beautiful golden yellow. Some trees stayed a beautiful deep green year-round. Spring was the best time to admire the trees. The bright green buds of newly forming leaves were a sight to behold, and the blooms of colorful flowers were always beautiful. I did not appreciate them then. They were the most mundane thing in the world that I took for granted. I never thought I would wake up in this dreary future. If I knew I would have made different choices. 
In the first few years following the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the world seemed to be getting back to normal. New infections tended to be mild, with fatal cases becoming less commonplace. I was four years old when I caught a mild case of the virus. I barely had a sniffle. Little did we know, a storm was brewing. 
In 2030 things began to change. Teenagers and young adults began to have major health issues similar to those who were diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, (CJD). It wasn't uncommon to see someone in that age group become extremely violent or have a serious grand mal seizure in public. Emergency rooms and hospitals soon became too overwhelmed to cope with the influx of patients, far worse than at any point during the height of the pandemic.
Before 2030 there were isolated clusters of patients in small communities who didn’t have a lot of contact with the outside world. Most of the clusters were attributed to heavy metals or industrial contamination. A few were even speculated to be caused by radiation from previous nuclear testing in the 20th century. When young people everywhere started showing the same sickness the government took notice. Finding the cause became the top priority.
Almost all governmental spending was directed to finding the cause and a cure. Scientists from every country worked day and night to find the reason this was happening. Blood, tissue, and cerebral fluid samples were taken from every patient suffering from the disease, but no apparent cause was found. In 2031, against ethical advice, a worldwide moratorium was enacted. It made an autopsy with a brain dissection a requirement when a patient died of the disease. It went against many religious beliefs and cultural traditions.
It didn’t go unnoticed that only people between the ages of eleven and twenty-five were affected. There were some outliers such as those who entered puberty early or were behind in sexual development. The two things all patients had in common were a previous infection of COVID-19 and a never before seen pathogen. Those older than twenty-five also showed evidence of infection with the unknown pathogen, but it could not affect a fully mature brain. Scientists and the general public began to push for the declassification of documents relating to the early days of the pandemic.
After more than a decade of denial, various governments and the WHO finally released documents that proved that the virus had been genetically modified. The Chinese government had been officially cleared of wrongdoing. It was a biological terrorist attack by an unknown terrorist organization. Though an unmodified version of the virus was pinpointed in a bat-infested cave in the Chinese wilderness. While the virus naturally mutated on its own through normal transmission, there was documentation proving several variants had also been modified and reintroduced into the population. 
One unnamed variant had been modified to behave like an incomplete prion. On its own, it was harmless after the body fought off the infection, but when coinfection was present the leftover proteins became a full-blown prion infection. Doctors were at a loss because this variant had been around for almost a decade with little to no evidence of causing additional disease. Running out of time to find a solution, doctors looked into those isolated clusters. Bodies were exhumed against familial wishes and autopsy reports were examined with a fine-toothed comb. Except for one area suffering the aftermath of a horrific case of industrial contamination, every case showed the same evidence as in current cases. 
Governmental agencies spared no expense in rushing to test the soil and water in those communities, as well as the water in major cities. Nearly every sample contained the unknown pathogen. It was determined that the pathogen could only be transmitted by drinking contaminated water, but it only caused harm to those previously infected by that exact COVID variant. Evidence strongly pointed to another biological attack. This one was far more insidious.
The only certain information was that the terrorist organization had to have ties in nearly every country in the world. When the news hit the mainstream media almost total anarchy ensued. The world’s economy tanked almost overnight and countries placed blame on everyone else. The world was on the brink of war. 
In 2035 when I was seventeen I began experiencing extreme bouts of rage and had my first grand mal seizure. I knew my days were numbered. Very few resources were allocated to finding the cure and only a few private companies still cared enough to search for one. I could feel my body and mind deteriorating by the day. I had less than a year before I would become bedridden and less than two before dying outright. When BioFlame sent a letter in the mail giving me a chance to participate in a medical trial for a cure, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.
Convincing my mom to sign permission was one of the hardest things I had to do. She was reluctant to allow me to take part, though she never gave me a reason why. With permission secured and after a lengthy application and screening process, I was flown to BioFlame’s medical spa facility in the Colorado Rockies. Infusions and tests were daily and were hard to deal with, but it was like staying in a luxury hotel so the time between treatments was bearable. Other people my age were also taking part in the trial. Everyone came from different racial, cultural, and national backgrounds, but we found common ground and became a close-knit group.
It wasn’t long before we all showed signs of improvement. Something didn’t feel right though. Questions we asked the medical team was often met with answers like “That information is classified” or the question evaded outright. Those who questioned too much tended to suffer relapses and had to be removed from the trial. I decided to keep questions to myself and just observe. The staff was also very tight-lipped about what was happening in the outside world. To keep us out of the loop we were given college-level courses to distract us from worrying. 
Many courses were scientific and mathematical based, but we were also given fun courses such as gardening, cooking, and crafting. On rare occasions, we were able to camp on the grounds far away from the main campus. On those camping trips, we fished, learned how to forage, and learned to prepare meals by campfire. Our days were full and we were kept busy, but life was better than any of us could have hoped for six months before.
On the day it happened every participant was woken with extreme urgency. We were used to being woken up before daybreak if we had a test that needed to be performed early. It was normally just a few of us, but this time all of us were woken up and ushered to the auditorium. They told us there was a serious breach of security and the facility was in danger of a terrorist attack. We were given the option of returning home or being transferred to another facility. Only sixteen out of twenty-five chose to be transferred. The others were taken to be discharged while the rest were walked to the main campus building.
This building was where the offices and labs were located. Every lab or office we passed was devoid of people and looked to be cleaned out in a hurry. It took a while to reach our destination. At the end of a long hallway was a door that had an obvious high level of security. It required a key card and retina scan. We were given one last chance to back out but none of us took it. Before entering the door each of us had to have our retinas scanned to make sure of our identity. That was strange but we didn’t have time to ponder it, because as soon as we walked through we were met with armed soldiers. 
The soldiers escorted us to a large elevator at the end of the corridor. It was already filled with crates and there was very little space for us to squeeze in. The soldiers ordered us inside and followed. The doors closed and as the elevator began to move it was rocked by a large explosion that knocked us all to the floor. I saw a soldier swipe a card that caused the elevator to descend fast enough to make everyone sick. It seemed like the ride lasted a lifetime. When it finally stopped a voice spoke in a foreign language and the elevator was filled with a cool mist. I’m pretty sure it was filled with a calming agent because none of us should have been as calm as we were.
When the mist settled the doors opened to an underground train station. We were instructed to wait until our names were called. When my name was called I was led to a train cabin with two sets of bunk beds. I was assigned to one of the bottom bunks and told to wait for further instructions. Soon enough another person, Samir, was led into the cabin. He was assigned to the other bottom bunk. We made small talk and speculated what was happening, but we had no real clue. A little while later workers in coveralls brought in two crates with our personal belongings and had us check that the contents belonged to us. 
After what seemed like hours a nurse and soldier entered our cabin. They would be our cabin mates. The nurse gave us a quick exam and our IV infusion before allowing us to eat a little bit. When the train started to move she told us the journey would be long and to ease our discomfort would be given medication to prevent motion sickness. She injected each of us and I felt a haze settle over my eyes as the nurse helped me to lie down the soldier did the same for Samir. The soldier never said a word.
Two days ago I woke up in a small room with only a hospital gown. I was completely confused about my surroundings, the only familiar sight being Samir, who looked just as confused. My legs completely collapsed when I tried to stand. I couldn’t get up and just as I was about to cry I heard a door opening from another direction. I couldn’t move enough to see from where. Two nurses entered the room asking us to keep calm. Samir seemed to be able to move better than I could. 
The nurses gave us a few injections and then wheeled us to a cafeteria. We were fed the blandest meal I’ve ever tasted. Eating helped to clear my head a little. Looking around I saw other familiar faces, but many others I did not know. There were around fifty of us. They all looked as confused as I felt and the room was almost silent except for the sound of clinking silverware.
After a little while, someone came out to clear the tables and left each of us an envelope. When everyone received it a vaguely familiar man walked to the podium in the front of the room. He began to speak and everyone’s attention became focused on him.
“What I am about to tell you will come as a shock to everyone in this room. I apologize but the food you just consumed was laced with a mild tranquilizer” the man said. That explained why everyone was extremely quiet and barely moved.
“You were selected by BioFlame to be our future.” He continued “The world was sick and needed to heal”
“We set events in motion to make the world a healthier place, but the governments thought they knew better.” There was a sharp collective intake of breath. Most of us likely came to the same conclusion at that moment.
“In 2002 we closely monitored and studied the SARS virus. We learned more about virology than anyone had in a century. For years we searched for another virus we could use to implement our plans” He sounded almost giddy.
“In late 2018 our search was over. This one was almost identical but we knew it needed to be weaker, or it would be noticed too soon. We tweaked it just a tiny bit, just enough where it would take a while to leap to humans.” he pauses to take a sip of water.
“Neither bat nor pangolin was the vector we used. It was the common stray cat, an animal everyone overlooks and would never suspect. It finally made the jump sometime in the Summer of 2019. A very smart scientist at the Wuhan lab caught on fast, but we silenced her before she could alert Chinese officials.” He laughed a little bit.
When I looked around I saw mostly horrified faces but a few were nodding along agreeing with every word. Everyone I knew looked as sick as I felt.
“The Chinese almost halted our plan in its tracks, when they took control in Wuhan. That’s when we made a small tweak and released infected cats into Italy and New York. You know how it went from there.” Taking another sip before continuing
“We started to see our world rapidly healing. Fish returned to Venice and pollution levels were at a century's low, but people are stubborn and corporations are greedy. Once things started to return to normal we knew we had to shift everything back on track” he sounded grave.
“A decade before we found COVID we stumbled upon a prehistoric virus in the melting permafrost. After some serious experimentation, it was easily modified to suit our needs. We first tested it at the beginning of 2021 and it worked perfectly if a little too fast. Trial and error in other places solved that issue.” 
Dread filled my entire body. Knowing it was the fault of this man that so many died. Knowing he was the reason I hated my entire existence. I wanted to scream and throttle this man, but the drugs kept me from doing anything other than breathing.
“Before we inoculated the water supply, a cure was already developed. We watched each of you before giving you the chance to be cured. You were chosen for several reasons. First, each of you had a relative within BioFlame, the second was your level of intelligence and drive to succeed, and finally, your lack of criminal record. The last step was for you to make that call” He proudly boasted.
“Several didn’t make it here. Those who were ejected or chose to leave still received the cure, so do not worry for them.” I was still reeling from information overload and almost missed the last bit. I quickly refocused my attention.
“When the situation became known to the public we knew we had very little time. We cryogenically froze you to bring you here today in 2060. Don’t argue that it is impossible, with our resources we worked out the kinks by 2005. Other groups have awoken in the last few months. They adapted and so will you.” He demanded.
“When I leave this room you will be shown films to catch you up on major world events. Every accommodation will be provided to you to help you adjust. We have given each of you a packet detailing your role in our society and what is expected of you. Relax and settle in the best you can. People who have been in your place will be here to assist you when the film finishes” He then left the room.
Everything was overwhelming and I didn’t know whether I was insane or having a nightmare. The films were enlightening but horrifying. When the other people entered the room I caught other familiar faces, some I thought to be dead. They were very helpful, but most of them looked as dejected as I felt. Feeling too overwhelmed to even glance at my packet, I asked to be shown to my room. I went directly to my bed and slept.
Yesterday passed in a blur. Every part of our lives was assigned to us. We only had the illusion of free will. Our chromosomes were even modified to only be able to have children with our assigned mate. Today I am just processing it all. I wish I had chosen to go home.
The compound was beautiful but you couldn’t miss that it overlooked the barren wasteland that used to be Raleigh. War had ravaged the area. Once upon a time, I bet it was beautiful. Tears filled my eyes as I stared at the landscape. A hand settles on my shoulder and I look up to see Samir, my friend, and assigned mate.
“We have to make the best of it and be careful” he whispers
“I miss the trees,” I say with a tearful voice
“Me too” he agrees, settling beside me.

Bob floated in the void, perpetually flipping end over end. The endless tumbling wasn't so bad when he didn't have a point of reference. He got super nauseous when he passed a nearby star or planet. Lucky for him, that hadn't happened in a few thousand years. Or was it unlucky? After all, he had been floating through space for hundreds of millions, maybe billions of years.
Getting sucked into a star, gas giant, or even a black hole would have at least been a refreshing change of pace. But Bob wasn't that lucky. In fact, Bob was probably the unluckiest person in the whole fucking universe because, as far as he knew, he was the only person in the universe. He was utterly alone. One might think that Bob, having traversed several galaxies and billions of celestial bodies, would have been caught in something's, anything's gravity. That wouldn't have done him any good, though. It's not like he could die.
Bob wasn't anyone special on Earth, back when the planet was still a thing. He had always found it strange that he continued to vividly retain his memories of Earth after all the time that had passed since its destruction. Bob remembered himself, his family, and everything that had occurred in his life. That probably had to do with his second wish. But here's the thing, the second one wasn't even his idea. It was the old man's, the one who granted him the three wishes.
Bob had been sitting in Smitty's tavern, same as any other Friday night, and honestly, same as most nights. He had just begun sipping his fifth gin & tonic when the door to the tavern swung open. Through the open door stepped a bearded white-haired man in a cream-colored cotton suit, with a crisp white shirt underneath. The man stood at the entrance, stroking his long flowing beard, searching the bar, until he finally turned his gaze to Bob.
When the white-haired man saw Bob, he raised his brow as if to say, ah, there you are, as though they had been planning to meet the entire time. The man casually walked to the end of the bar, where Bob always sat, and pulled up a stool next to him. The bartender came over to take the man's order, but he politely declined and asked for water. The man then turned to Bob and said. "You have three wishes. Go."
It's not like Bob had any company, and he was drunk, so what could it possibly hurt to play along with a crazy old man? "Anything I want?" asked Bob.
"Anything." replied the old man.
"I wish I could live forever."
"Done. Just know, there can be only one immortal thing in existence, and that's about to be you."
"About to be?" asked Bob.
"Yeah, it won't take effect until after you've made all three wishes. Also, just because you're going to live forever doesn't mean you can't get sick. You could perpetually live with something that regenerates, like cancer."
Bob turned his mouth downward in mock concern. "We don't want that."
"No, we do not. Might I suggest your second wish?"
"Alright, let's hear it," laughed Bob. He downed his drink and flagged the bartender for another.
"How about your second wish be that you never fall to any illness. Not of the body, not of the mind."
Bob shrugged. "Sure, why the hell not?"
"Done," said the old man. "You've got one left, and I bet you everything in existence that you're going to pick something selfish like money."
Bob took offense to that. "And just what is that supposed to mean?" he asked angrily.
"It's human nature. You guys only want what's best for yourselves. Not the whole."
Bob's face softened into a thoughtful expression. Booze made him easy-going that way. "Did I hear you bet everything? In all of existence?"
The old man's mouth turned up in a crooked grin. "Indeed, you did."
"That's a pretty big wager, sir. I don't believe it's yours to make, seeing as how not everything is yours to bet."
"You'd be surprised," said the old man, extending his hand to shake on the wager.
Bob looked at the white-haired man's hand. "Sort of seems like we're focusing more on this bet than on my final wish."
The man threw his head back and laughed heartily. Not in a sinister or maniacal way, but more like Santa Clause or a grandpa hearing a funny story. "My son," he said, catching his breath from laughing at his own inside joke. "This bet and your third wish are the same. You and I are the same. Time is an immeasurable circle, beginning at this point, in this very bar." The old man squinted curiously. "Funny thing, though. Last time you were sitting over there."
The old man pointed to the opposite end of the bar and shook his head. "One would think I'd have a better understanding of time than anyone, but I suppose I designed all of it to surprise me on occasion." He shrugged. "Where's the fun in always knowing what's going to happen?"
Bob sat, staring with a slack-jawed expression, unsure if the old man was mocking him or just had dementia. "Time is a circle beginning in this bar? What the fuck are you talking about, buddy? Are you busting my balls?"
"Don't pay me any mind," said the old man apologetically. "I'm just a lonely old man, ranting and raving."
Feeling like a jerk, Bob dropped his attitude and extended his hand. "I"ll take your bet. Considering I'll do the opposite of what you're suggesting I'm going to do, I'll win everything in existence. I already know the outcome."
"Hey, so do I!" replied the old man excitedly, shaking Bob's outstretched hand. "It's a bet."
Bob downed his drink, wiping his mouth with a sleeve. "I wish for world peace."
"Just to be clear," said the old man. "You wish for the world to be at peace? True peace?"
"What other kind of peace is there?"
The old man raised his brow to the question. "Oh, there's all kinds. I can list them off if you'd like, but in my humble opinion, true peace is the peak of the concept."
"Fine," said Bob, growing impatient with the old man's veiled speech. "I wish for the world to be at true peace."
"Done!" said the old man clapping his hands together loudly, startling the bartender and several of the patrons.
"Well, I guess you lost the bet," Bob said with a smirk.
"Guess so," shrugged the man. "I lost the bet."
"You going to give me my three wishes and everything in existence now?"
"Indeed, I am." The old man held out his finger. "Go ahead, Bob. Give it a pull."
Bob squinted at the old man. He might have been drunk, but he wasn't oblivious. "I don't remember telling you my name, buddy." He backed his stool away from the bar, now wary of the white-haired, bearded man. "How did you know my name?"
Still holding out his finger, the man gave Bob a sheepish grin. "You wouldn't believe me if I told you. I know this because I've attempted to tell you time and time again. You never believe me, though."
Bob rubbed his eyes, annoyed and officially over the old guy's game. "If I pull your finger, will you go away?"
"Oh absolutely,"
"Immediately?"
"Immediately." finished the old man.
Bob sighed and grabbed the man's finger, pausing for some reason to look the man in the eyes. He had the greenest eyes Bob had ever seen, which was odd because that's what people said about Bob.
The old man smiled warmly. "Until next time, my son."
"Sure thing, old-timer," said Bob, pulling the man's finger. Suddenly the man and his finger disintegrated into a white flame. The flame was blinding, and as Bob shielded his eyes from its brilliance, he heard the most ear-shattering noise in the history of Earth, and that statement was a fact considering it was the sound of the planet exploding. Then Bob was flying indescribably fast through the edgeless expanse of space, completely and utterly alone.

When Zyra's family had been allocated the land and the house for free, they did not mistake it for a gift. It was, however, an opportunity for the family to rise above the unfortunate circumstances that had displaced them all. Zyra's mother had lost her Singaporean citizenship as they'd been on public assistance for far too many generations. Nevertheless, her skills had kept them afloat in the early years that the family had settled on the wet Florida coastal town.
She opened a chili crab restaurant under their stilt house. People ate her food on plastic tables when it was dry and in their boats when everything flooded. The concept only worked because the land surrounding their home proliferated with crabs due to the changing environment. They weren't the right kind for the original dish, but they were big enough, and their meat was just as good with the right tweaks to the recipe. Zyra's father did not think the crabs were 'muddy' as his wife thought. He'd been born in Lebanon and had never even tasted crab before he'd met Zyra's mother in the refugee processing center. Zyra's father was the lynchpin of the family. It was he who had won the immigration lottery, he who had gotten a job at the package distribution center. And he who toiled for poverty wages to support the visas of Zyra's half-brothers who'd been born in Singapore, and her mother.
Her father's and her brother's jobs were why the country allowed her family to come in at all. Not enough low-end workers to fill the needs of the warehouses, scrub the corporate toilets, or man the counters of the shops. Yet, even for those jobs, Zyra's mother was considered unsuitable. She did not have the right papers to prove that she had not committed any crimes in her home country. Nor did she have the right birth certificate for one of her sons. He'd been born on the same boat that the family had been fishing on since the early 2030s. Zyra never saw her parents argue despite the differences in their upbringing. Still, she wondered as she got older how they reconciled their circumstances, how they'd managed to find joy working without a break for years on end.
Zyra herself was American, the only American in the family because she was born in a hospital in Boca Raton. The hospital itself was now totally reclaimed by the sea. The family had invested everything in her. Once, they had gone without gas in their boat for an entire month. They did this to pay the Singh family down the road to tutor her for the ACT. Her brother, Lee, worked as a janitor at the university to get her reduced tuition, commuting for two hours every day for four years.
Contrary to the usual paths for immigrant children: medicine, law, or pharmacy, the family made itself the topic of gossip when they decided she would study Oceanography in college and get an internship with NOAA- which had become quite well funded in recent years to track the climate changes happening all over the country and the world at large. When she'd asked why they had chosen such a path for her, the only answer her parents ever gave her was, "for your future." It didn't explain how becoming a climate scientist was more secure and lucrative than healthcare, but she assumed her parents had their reasons. After what they had sacrificed so much for her, she felt she didn't have much right to argue with them about it. She also quite liked the subject and felt drawn to work towards aiding the study of the environmental crisis of their age. 
Her father had managed to save a considerable dowry from his paltry paycheck to give to the unofficial mayoral family of the town, the Chowdarys. Their son, Tashi, was one of the most handsome men in Ghranagar and planning to attend the same university. However, his father had initially been unwilling to marry his son off to a non-Indian, especially considering that most of the families in Ghranagar were from the same slice of southern India. Zyra never knew why he'd approved the match in the first place. Was it Zyra's racial ambiguity due to her parent's mixed marriage? Or simply his father's desire to have some capital to play with to build the family up to the middle class? Regardless, the connections she'd gained through marrying Tashi at 19 years old added to what her family and Ghranagar had contributed to Zyra's future. She viscerally felt their dreams and hopes for what their American lives could be riding in her in every choice. So, when she returned 11 years later, freshly widowed, boatless, and unemployed, she did so not with sadness for her reduced circumstances but rather with dread of their judgment.
She came into town on the public ferry at high tide, her belly large with six months of pregnancy and a faux leather-bound notebook open over it. She used herself as a table to sketch and write her impression of Ghranagar's central market. She has not been back for nearly six years.
Outsiders had called Ghranagar "the American Venice," but now that title was being applied liberally to many coastal immigrant communities. Ghranagar had been one of the first to capitalize on the gimmick by serving chili gelato or fusion masala shrimp pizza from their brightly colored windows on coolers days when tourists would motor through to sightsee, and people watch.
It was dusk as the ferry broke the eerily still water of the main channel through town. Zyra had expected to see Christmas lights strung up and wooden furniture on the porches of the stilted buildings, but she saw only darkness and boarded-up windows. At 8:30 pm, people should have been out of the house, enjoying the cooler air and lack of UV rays. But Ghranagar looked like a town of ghosts on the water.
The ferry dropped her off onto a port dock as the light darkened enough that she couldn't see what she was writing. She pooled her little money together with a group of locals to rent a zip boat. She was dropped off first out of courtesy for her condition at her parents' house. Zyra's father met her downstairs and helped her off the boat, carrying her bags up the stairs to the living level.
"Have you eaten dinner yet?" His words were colorless after giving her a firm hug at the top of the stairs.
"I had a half of a fish sandwich on the ferry."
"That doesn't sound like food," he sighed, "there's hummus and bread from today in the icebox. You can tell me all about work while we wait for your mother to come back from the town hall meeting."
She eyed him sheepishly, trying not to take his mention of work like a punch in the gut.
Sitting at the table, swishing the olive oil around her hummus with the corner of her pita, she wondered how she would tell him. After Tashi's funeral, she would stay and work as a bookkeeper for the Chowdary's business. She would be sleeping in Tashi's room and taking their charity, like a refugee herself.
She could see her mother had hung up the boys' and her father's clothes for the funeral tomorrow night in the front of the living room closet. They wouldn't smell musty if they'd air out for the night in the breeze. Everything got so moist in the house if the sea breeze didn't touch it.
As she stared at the fading black fabric, her father slipped an envelope gently under her fingers. It was red and fat with a cheesy "double happiness" character on the top. She knew it was full of money that would doubly fill her with guilt.
"Stop," she said, sliding it back, "this isn't going to help me as much as it would help you guys."
"Nonsense," he breathed casually, "rent is expensive down there. So Chowdary is going to send Sathya to live with you for a while to help you with the baby while you're in the lab. It's already been arranged."
Her breath stopped in her throat. Her father had spoken to Tashi's father but not recently enough to know what had happened.
"Papa, I'm not going back to NOAA," she choked out, not meeting his eyes. He said nothing at first, and the silence stretched out before them.
When she did manage to look at him once more, she saw only blankness. Zyra knew it held back a tidal wave he was struggling to contain.
"I can't live on the salary of an assistant researcher with a baby. Even with one of Tashi's cousins to take care of the house and help me out."
"But this is ridiculous! You got life insurance from him, and you've been there for four years. Isn't it time they took that silly word, 'assistant' off your title?"
"Need a Ph.D. to do that, and Papa, when am I going to have time for that with everything that's happened this year…" she trailed off, not knowing how to continue the sentence.
"Even more stupid! You can give the child to Chowdary or to us. More than enough time to do one of those executive programs. How long will it take?"
She met his incredulity with coldness, "I'm not doing it."
"What are you going to do then?"
She looked away again in shame, the food in her belly becoming ash and weighing her down.
"You're going to live on Chowdary's boat?" His hands were on the table, pressing down harder than she'd ever seen.
She steadied herself before answering. "I'll be in Tashi's room in the big house. Tashi's old job in the office. Just until the baby comes, and I figure out what to do."
"You're going back to work on Monday," he insisted, "you have a month or two left to think about this."
She shook her head, "I quit. I can't do it anymore. There's no future for me there."
"Don't be an idiot. The only future for you here is a hammock on that garbage boat," he spat.
"No, Papa. He said I could stay in the house. It's going to be fine," she tried to calm him down, noticing that he was getting seriously agitated.
He met her eyes as he pounded his fist on the table, "the state is evacuating everyone to the refugee center in Orlando next week." He spoke, but she did not register his words. When she said nothing back, he continued.
"It's all condemned—the whole town. The government gave us a new house. It's dry, but it's in West Virginia. How will you work the sea there? Do you even know where they are sending Chowdary? Because he hasn't even told me. Ghranagar is done, and everyone who can't buy their way into something in the state is being separated."
Zyra sat there in stunned silence, feeling a growing ache in her stomach quickly become a panic. The entire Ghranagarian ecosystem, the Arabs and the East Asians, South Asians, the bahnimi sandwiches, and the lemon trees would all be scattered. Her childhood world was to be blown apart. The horror of her parents' lives was to be reborn in hers. 
"Why now?" Yet, he didn't need to answer. She slowly put the pieces together in her head, "they are using that tropical storm on the edge of the gulf as an excuse?"
He nodded, the anger finally purpling his face slightly, "mandatory evacuation for a tropical storm. We've sat in this house during category three hurricanes waiting for FEMA boats that never came."
"Mama is at the meeting trying to petition the state to reverse it." She finished for him.
They sat in silence. Zyra's notebook was on the table between them. She'd stuffed it with the stories of her neighbors- Arabian fairy tales, stories of people running away from pimps and gangsters in Hyderabad, and even a few regalements of her and Tashi's adolescent forays in Ghranagar.
"When will you call NOAA and ask for your job back?" He said pointedly. It was not really a question, Zyra knew.
She put her hand on the front of the notebook, asking it for its strength. "This doesn't change anything about that choice I made, Papa."
"How do you think your mother would feel about you living on Chowdary's boat? Will she think his marine waste business is better than working for NOAA? What about when he gets sent off to the west coast? Do you think that's better? What about when he marries you off to a cousin you don't know?"
She laughed incredulously, "what year do you think this is, Papa?"
He bit back sharply, "What were you thinking?! Why do you want to quit NOAA?"
She rose, meeting his anger with an icy coldness that steeled against the humid haze that hung in the house as the breeze died out, "I know that I won't be able to help as much monetarily now that I don't work for the government anymore. But my husband is dead, Papa, and our child will be born not knowing him. At the very least, I want it to have some family in its life. Tashi and I had so much of that growing up here. Even if that means disappointing you all and proving what a poor investment I was, I want my child to have that."
She turned, briefly seeing her father shake his head in disagreement, getting out, "no, you do not understand," before she stormed out of the house. Zyra grabbed the family's only dingy and motored away from her father as he called to her. She chose not to hear him.
She docked at Chowdarys' house, noticing all of the boats were gone. Most of the adults were probably at the town hall with her mother. Alham, one of the aunties, was in the kitchen. She offered Zyra a lassi, some biscuits, and her company. Two boys, Tashi's cousins, were running under her feet, playing a chasing game while Alham periodically shouted at them to get ready for bed.
"Your father told you," She guessed correctly simply by staring at Zyra's face.
"Yes, I'm devastated. How do you feel about it?" She had known Alham all her life. The woman had been in Ghranagar for as long as it has been a town.
"Me? I'm grieving my nephew. Everything else is inconsequential. The rest of my family is healthy, business is good, and I have a grandnephew on the way," her smile was infectious and wormed its way into Zyra's heart as it always did. "Whether my home is here or in California, Washington, Alaska- I don't mind. My family is together."
Alham's smile broke into her, twisted, and became a sieve that finally let out the floodgate of Zyra's emotions. She burst into tears at Alham's table.
Alham came to her, wrapping her as wholly and tightly as she would a child. She was round and sturdy in a way that Zyra's mother had never been. She was immensely comfortable to be around. Zyra felt safe enough to let out the thorn gnawing at her since she'd arrived back home.
"I'm such a failure!" It exploded from her like a burst dam. "Tashi is gone, and I'm doomed without him to help us. I've disappointed my parents and his parents- everyone. And he'd probably be disappointed in me too," she got out between sobs, burying her face in Alham's chest.
The woman pulled her back and wiped her tears on a clean kitchen napkin. Then, looking at her in the eye, she held her shoulders steadily, "you are your parents' wildest dream. What you do will help us all."
Zyra wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her dirty shirt, "Doing Papa Chowdary's accounting isn't that important."
Alham held her chin abruptly, "you don't remember, do you?"
The intensity of her gaze transfixed Zyra.
"Beta, the first night of your wedding! We sent your father in to tell you. He was to tell you the wish of all of us—our united wish for you. You were so nervous about the ceremony and the party. I painted your hands with the henna, and your mother painted your face. Don't you remember what he said to you?"
She tried to think back, but Alham's intensity was making it impossible to think around the fog of feelings. Alham's eyes bore into her. It was the eyes that spoke to her, spoke deep into her soul. The eyes continued to paint a scene that she could not reliably recall without them.
"We were giving you Tashi, and your parents were giving you a university education for your future. It didn't have anything to do with earning money. That's what you thought he was probably telling you at the time. That we were sending you south to study to lift us out of poverty, this was not what we intended. Beta, my Zyra, the world is drowning. All of us here were displaced because people thought more of lining their own pockets than having dry land to raise their children. In you and our Tashi, who was to support you, we wanted to contribute something that our ancestors had not. We gave you all of this for your future and your children's future. You are not a disappointment. You are the reason we can rest peacefully. You are our security and our penance. You are our love and our hope."
Zyra found there was nothing more she could say to that. So she fell into Alham's arms again and allowed the auntie to carry her to the dock. Her father greeted them at the edge of it. He had just arrived on a neighbor's dingy, having come after her to explain.
But he did not need to explain. Now Zyra remembered and knew what her community had meant for her at last.

The blog woods had never looked so beautiful. With the dove gray sand cushioning Ophi’s feet and the dark connectrees shielding the clearing from the sky, Ophi stood in awe as though he had never been there before. Could it be?
The Internet user cocked his head to whistling coming from a gray bush, and saw a bright pink ad-bird wading out of the bush. Ophi recognized the bird and something lit up inside him. He turned back and saw a clear path leading to a leafier area. Thick, dark green wood greeted Ophi with a list of the users that lived here. 
His own name at the bottom of the sign was nearly reduced to scratches. It had been so long.
Ophi’s hooves thundered against the smooth road. He kept running until he reached a cul de sac rimmed with user-sized bushes. Ophi cocked his ears and heard nothing. So Ophi ran over to the bushes and skimmed them until he found the thorn bushes. He frowned. He felt a twinge of remorse for choosing thorn plants for his fencing.
Ophi turned and flicked his tail at the bushes. That didn’t matter. The sky was a cool white, the connectrees were as robust as ever, and all was right again.
But then, Ophi heard a distant rustling. The bushes across from him rustled and gave way. 
Another user. She was red, like Ophi, except she resembled a geometric doe. Ophi waited. The doe slinked closer. 
Ophi bucked in joy. “Heidi!” 
Both users galloped towards one another. The clearing around them stretched wide into a field. 
Ophi squealed, “Heidi, it’s been so long!”
The doe scampered on without a word.
“Heidi?”
The doe’s polygonal face wrenched open to reveal a visceral bear trap coming for Ophi’s face. 
The dream ended.
Ophi lurched to the side and destroyed a table in the process. He could still hear snapping teeth. He couldn’t think if the droplets on him were his own sweat or Heidi’s spit. 
Then Ophi remembered. He was no longer a browsing user, sleeping in his own grove. No, he gave that up just to become a homeless fire serpent.
The cold grays of the abandoned site settled in, only to be blurred again by Ophi’s tears. “Why? Why? Why can’t I forget?”
Ophi’s throat tightened. No. Just stop that. If you waste your tears on that pig, you won’t be able to hunt today.
Ophi forced himself out of his coils and slithered across the room. Beyond the narrow doorway was a huge hallway with one wall having a weblike, abstract mural. Ophi searched the dark pattern, ignoring the dust irritating his eyes, until he saw an elaborate circle. He rammed his tail into the circle and the mural changed to a mirror.
Yes, Ophi had big doe eyes, but his focus darted to the blood red tear stains. The stains against his paper white face were hideous, making his eyes look more like gaping holes.
Ophi squinted and sneered. And like a poison dart frog’s spots, my face is now a warning sign. Maybe the boars will leave me alone today.
The tip of Ophi’s tail rose up next to his face. He still hadn’t gotten used to his nose. It jutted out so much it looked less like a human nose and more like a shark’s. 
Well, it was enough to keep Ophi out of the uncanny valley, and with the huge fangs crammed into his mouth, he could befriend the local artists. The thought of that happening made him uneasy. Their habitat still felt too gloomy for his liking.
Ophi shifted his eyes to an old trash can. But… Considering what happened with Heidi… Ophi felt tears welling up again, Just forget her. It was going to happen one way or another.
Ophi made his way out of the hallway and into a room just like the one he was sleeping in, except for the gaping hole serving as a doorway. Ophi slithered out of that and into the edge of a connectree forest. 
The leaves of the connectrees Ophi was familiar with came in cyan or gray. The ones here were a somber purple and hung on the branches like rags. The branches themselves drooped, too. Ophi looked around. Besides the forest to his left, he saw obelisks and other carved stones lying in the white grass. Ophi had to squint to see the stone platform ahead, with everything beyond that obscured with fog. 
Ophi saw a flicker or two in the fog. Ophi crept forward. His fiery colors stuck out among the dreary purples and grays here. Whiffs of smoke rose up from under Ophi and sickened the air. Ophi could see them, all humanoids with black hair reaching their knees and paper white skin. More showed up, and Ophi spotted dark purple gills on their necks, and purple circlets around their limbs. 
Ophi’s heart thumped inside him. Some of them began to dance, making the thought of them rushing at Ophi even worse. The venomous spines hidden throughout his body threatened to explode out of their pores. 
But something crawled onto the platform. Something pitch black and the size of a horse. Raising its striped, abstract head, it stood on its scarlet points of feet. It was a nightmare of a quadruped.
And one of the humanoids walked up to the creature and tousled its head like it was a pet. 
See? Ophi told himself, If that abomination can walk on that platform scot-free, then so can you. The ones that enjoy strange company are the most understanding, after all. Go up and say ‘Hi.’
Ophi barked and the users turned his way. They were only staring at him, so it may be safe. Ophi slithered on the platform. There was silence, and it burned Ophi’s composure.
Finally, one of the piscine users put out a hand. “Hello! Who are you?”
Ophi’s voice came out like a tortured violin. “I’m just a lurker who’s enjoying your art.” 
The littler users broke into chatter. Inevitably, one of the users asked, “Can we visit your place?”
Ophi’s mouth clamped shut like a vice. The spines hidden in his body pushed against the pores. It took a silent breath to relieve the pressure. “You know I am not just a hobbyist, right?”
“No, we just met you.” The red and black creature stood with his legs splayed out.
The hidden spines pressed against Ophi like teeth. “I mean … I don’t really have a blog … anymore.”
“We … don’t understand.” The red and black creature lowered his tail.
This was it. One wrong move and Ophi would lose another chance at normalcy. “Okay then tell me. There are no thorny creatures in this domain, right?”
The smaller creatures shared confused glances.
Then a squeal ruined the atmosphere. Another horse-sized blob rushed from the bushes behind the platform. The users, to Ophi’s bafflement, made room for the new contender. It looked just like a boar, one living as a venomous pin cushion!
Please, for the love of God, don’t hurt me! Ophi tensed his pores, but his mane rose to his defense.
One of the little humanoids waved to the pig. “Hello! Who are you?”
The boar opened his tusk-stuffed mouth, and shook his quills. Ophi’s heart sank. The more and more the boar talked, the more and more the spikes in both of them poked out.
The boar continued, “...And due to such analogies, I’ve come to realize what your art represents: it’s not just fanart, it’s warning signs. Signs against commonality, like this dime-a-dozen dragon in your midst!”
Ophi bristled. His pores felt like they were going to rip asunder if he didn’t say something. “I knew it, I knew it! You’re just here to start a fight. Well I won’t let you.”
The boar lunged. Ophi’s spikes exploded from his skin. Already blinded by pain, Ophi bit at the epicenter. Ophi clamped down on something hard and furry and pulled as hard as he could, but he fell over and let go for a split second. Both monsters were knocking into columns, obelisks, whatever couldn’t get out of the way. Then, with the boar sounding as livid and loud as ever, Ophi knocked into something sturdy. Pushing his back against the object, he pulled the boar off. Now the boar thrashed in his teeth.
Ophi pinned the boar to the ground and wrapped his coils around the squealing offender. He dove for the throat and squeezed on everything with all his might until the boar fell silent. Ophi rolled off the boar and collapsed in a bleeding heap. His vision allowed him to see the platform, only to blur into nothing.
Ophi opened his eyes and saw that the sky was an angry slate gray. Ophi noted he only felt sore throughout his body, no longer feeling burning cuts. When he curled up to rise, however, the blurry figures all around were the natives, scattered on the ground, with red spikes sticking out of their backs.
He turned to the boar. It looked less like a game animal and more like a cheap fur rug. The boar’s spikes were turquoise. 
Oh no.
The red and black creature hopped from behind an obelisk. He walked towards Ophi, with his head dipped low. 
Ophi felt something churn in his stomach. “I-I-I’m really sorry. I-I was only t-t-trying to drive off the boar-”
The creature threw his head up. “May the hackers come for your scales! You have no place here. Get out, and don’t come back.”
Ophi might as well have shrunk in front of the creature. Then Ophi gave a hard glare. “I figured.”
One of the pale users ran towards the creature. “Wait!”
Ophi turned back to the abandoned building. “No.”
Ophi felt throbbing all over his body. He ignored the slate walls at the corner of his eye. Maybe if I just avoid them for a while, they would understand. ...Would they understand?

WALKING  FLOWERS WILL GROW IN THIS LAWN and TREES WILL FLY
The colors, of course it was also their colors ,always, so living ( vivid) and dazzling ,  which gave him that idea. But, above all, it was their scent, so intense , yet also evanescent, which you could now perceive so strong, so all pervaded, sometimes even stunned or pungent, and which soon after you could no longer feel, as if it had dissolved in the air, as if wind had carried it away.  But here it is again, after just a moment or, however, when you did not expect, that cascade of perfume returned, more intense and all pervading than ever. And the smells of the different  flowers not only alternated, but  also  mixed, releasing incredible scents, always more than pleasant. Of course  Kevin knew well that it was far from that usually the scent of flowers would have inspire what inspired him.  Mostly their scent would suggest ( would have suggested) the creation of perfumes such as those which are then sold in pretty glass containers, packaged in very attractive packages , and launched on the market with advertisement that promised, indeed assured, wonders: yes, just that perfume to open the doors of Eden in front of you.  He, Kevin, instead, since he was a child, in front of an expanse of daisies, and golden buttons, of poppies and cornflowers, which peeped out, peering ( winking) from the green of a meadow, as well as  in front of the royal roses and the delicate lilies of a well-kept garden, had always thought, but even  hoped: oh, what a wonder it would be if these flowers, with their colors, with their scent, could move. Yes, if they could go for a walk , at least into the lawn or the garden where they are  .What a fantastic  show if these flowers could dance! And something like this he had always felt, more than thought, in front of the trees, with their arms outstretched towards the sky and yet so planted on the ground . “ Come trees, walk with me” And then the trees would have said him____they would have spoken him with the rustle of their leaves  moved by the wind____: “Other than walking, we are also able to fly, even to make you fly. Come on, Kevin, get on board and we’ll take off.
Kevin pondered, thought and thought again for years and years about he could realize his dream, his aspiration to give life to flowers and trees that were able to walk, to dance, even to fly. But it was only as an adult, when he had children, that he decided to work hard to make his dream come true. He would have like so much to be able to see his children  walking together with the flowers in their garden or in a meadow, that they could fly on the trees. When he started to experiment to make his dream come true, his wife Matilda began to glare at him, and to scold him harshly . According to her, his project was absurd and absolutely impossible to be  realized. It would only made him waste time and waste money. He, Kevin, stubbornly, continued to carry out his experiments, and to look  for others who,  like him, tried giving life to flowers and trees which were able to walk, to dance, and, why not? even to fly. Matilda then considered him crazy , and she wanted to put him in an asylum. Unfortunately even his children, whom he loved so much, raised (put up) by their mother, began to consider him crazy , and dangerous too.  Kevin had to realize , with dismay, that they were afraid of him, that they tried to avoid him ( to stay away from him). And even his friends , his neighbors , relatives  and acquaintances too, demanded that he would be locked up. Kevin felt and was now a hinted animal. He was hindered at every step he took. He could not even get supplies of what he needed for his experiments, which were regularly sabotaged. But he knew, he felt that he had to make his dream come true.  As much as he regretted it, as much as it was even heartbreaking for him to be separated from his beloved children, Kevin decided to leave. He thus began his wandering from one countryside to another countryside , looking for lawn (land) on which to grow his flowers, to plant his trees.  Kevin decided to devote himself soul and body to his project, to the realization of his dream. By now he spent even the nights into the shed , where he had arranged his laboratory in the best possible way.  He kept making crosses of seeds, inventing new fertilizers, experimenting with grafts.
He knew that here and there, scattered around the world, there were others who, like him, dreamed, and also tried to create flowers which could move, walk, even dance, and trees which could fly. Other people who, like him, were considered crazy and dangerous. It seemed that no one, other than those , not many, who had adventurously thrown themselves into it, took their research seriously. It was considered nothing more than a game, a waste of time, good just for idle brankles or, even, madmen. It often happened that when Kevin was looking for and trying how to make the roots of a plant was able to move, he suddenly saw Matilda, as if she reappeared, as if she were there. He saw again his wife looking at him with a fierce look , cursing at him, shouting at him that it was a time waster and a vagabond, and she, Matilda threatened him with the broom , too. What a ugly, grim face she had when she had hurled herself against him. Ah, he, Kevin didn’t really mind leaving her ( his wife). His children instead, Chris and Paul, oh, he felt a tightness in the heart, so strong, that he believed he was going to die, if only he thought of them. For them, to be able to see them again, to be with them again, he would also have given up his research. So when it happened to  think it, he tried to drive away the thought of them as soon as possible. And to succeed in it Kevin remembered his children as they had been with him lately, before he left. Then they too had considered him crazy, a poor madman. They had even been afraid of him.  Sure, his heart ached even remembering the frightened faces with which they, his children, had looked at him. But it ( remembering their faces in those days) also served him to drive them away from his mind, and to come back to his research, that no, he couldn’t leave.
The most difficult thing to deal with was even for Kevin___and he knew that the same was true for the others experimenters or…dreamers who had undertaken a research like his___(was )the fundamental link that every plant, flower or tree, had with the ground. A flower, like a tree, but also a blade of grass,  is born and grows in the soil ( ground, earth), it has its roots into the soil, it is planted in the ground. To make it ( one plant) to move, or even to fly, it meant ( implied) not only , somewhat, to uproot it from the ground, that is the indispensable habitat for its life, but also to endow it with some characteristic , or property, which, as a plant, does not belong to it. And not only that,   since it was) necessary to provide  the plant  you want it become able to move  with the proprieties of another genus , taking care, at the same time, that it ( the plant) maintained   intact its essence  as a vegetable, that it remained a flower, that it remained a tree.
Moreover Kevin, like almost all his fellow adventures, who wanted make their dream, of seeing flowers and plants move, walk, even fly come true, also worried that the flowers, after they had walked, they could go back to being flowers planted in the ground ( earth) of the garden or the lawn, that the trees, after they had taken off, could go back to being planted firmly in the ground.
There was someone, like Aldous  Kief in Kurdistan, or Julien Prix in Normandy, who was only interested in creating flowers and trees ( plants) capable of moving and flying, who did not care at all that , after the walk or the flight, they, the flowers, the trees,  come back with their roots anchored to the ground ( earth). But if the plants don’t come back to the the ground , with their roots in the earth they will die, the others pointed out. To be able to realize their dream Kevin, like his fellow adventures around in the world, knew that, of course, the selection of seeds, obtained   through genetic engineering, was of great importance, but it was also necessary a great work of research on the roots of flowers and trees. More precisely, on the roots and on the ground  in which they were planted. They all agreed that plants seeds, be flowers or trees, needed to be enhanced or added to with properties which did not belong to the plant kingdom, but rather to the animal kingdom. They were among them those who managed to obtain  truly extraordinary beings, even if monstrous, crosses between plants and animals which, although only a little and very slowly, were able to move. Needless to say that these very strange beings___plants or animals?___to which their experiments had given life , aroused protests from the people, who had come to know about these strange beings through the media. Televisions and newspapers spoke of monsters creators who threatened and upset too the balance of the planet, of mad scientists who were destroying nature. They were reactions that embittered also Kevin, like the  others, not many, who scattered, here and there in the world,  were engaged in the same research, an adventure that was a bet. Not at all mad scientists who wanted to subvert the laws of nature and upset the balance of the Earth ( of the plabet Earth). They just wanted their dream come true. Sure, there was  also something of the game , indeed theirs was a bet, there was also fun in their enterprise ( project). Yet they all thought that to manage to giving life  to plants capable to move, this (it) would have brought, in a more or less distant future, benefits to the Earth and to all its inhabitants.
Years passed. Kevin often thought of his children ( sons), who were grown up now, who had probably given birth to children. How much he would have liked  that at least his grandchildren could one day see flowers and plants move, trees fly.
With the relentless passing of the invisible time life was coming to the end. He, Kevin, had never abandoned his enterprise ( project). Sometimes he had almost succeeded in creating flowers capable to move, but unfortunately, after they had taken a few steps, so to say, they had gone limp , they had even become suddenly dry.  Ah, he had done something wrong in the fertilization or, maybe, in the treatment of the roots.  The roots and the seeds required a lot of attention.  Time went by, he became older and older. Yet the desire (the wish) to see his dream come true remained the same as when, many years earlier, he had left even his children to devote himself to realize it.  His children, who by now had long since grown up, and  who will have had children they too. How strange, over time Kevin, even though he kept feeling the fierce pain of when he had left them, he didn’t think anymore that he wanted to see them again.  Indeed never to see them again, this now was okay for him. Since they had grown up without him, far away from him.  They had had a life of their own, in which he had not been present. What sense would it make (have) to look for them after so long time?And he too had lived his life without them. He had suffered when he had left them, and even after then. Yet he had never come back, he hadn’t regretted his decision ( choose). When he thought his life was about to end, Kevin didn’t think he would  want to see again his sons ( children), to whom he was a perfect stranger. He  rather thought that before his life ended he would have wanted so much to succeed in creating trees capable of taking flight.  And, why not?  being able to fly on a tree. Yes, what a wonder to fly to the moon on the edge of a tree! Unfortunately, as much as he tried and tried again , Kevin never managed not only to fly to the moon, but even to fly much lower, getting aboard of a tree. However he was sure he had come close to being able to create flowers which could move, and trees which could fly. The secret was in the seeds to plant ( to use), which had to be very special. These seeds had to have, in addition to the characteristics , or qualities, which allowed them to germinate  in the earth( ground), also aerial , or rather aerodynamic qualities. These very special seeds would have given birth to plants that, even if terrestrial, they had also the propulsive thrust to detach themselves from the earth ( ground). Kevin wrote a treatise on properties that seeds had to have to obtain flowers and trees which can move, and even fly. Kevin’s treatise is still today, after more than a century, the almost complete text for all those who intend to realize Kevin’s dream to be able to reach the moon by flying on a tree.

The sun beat down on the scorched earth. The landscape was sparse, except for the occasional skeletal shrubs, scattered pieces of abandoned machinery, and bones. The faint but insistent beeping of his metal detector was maddening but was preferred to the anxiety inducing high pitched shrieks it made when it detected something. It could just be a piece of scrap from a long dead machine, or it could be a live bomb. He avoided all of them. He had lost track of how many days he had been patrolling the desert. It was becoming more difficult to tell what was real and what was mirage. He was beginning to think that each bush that he passed was in fact, a fallen soldier, baked alive by the relentless sun. Sometimes he thought that he saw them move, or that he heard their parched and raspy cries for help. Other times he thought he saw the half buried machines start to come alive again, he was afraid that they were going to pull themselves out of the sand and come after him. Despair was beginning to set in, a lot of the soldiers that were sent out into the desert didn’t come back. Even if he survived this he would be sent out on some other perilous mission. Scout soldiers were a dime a dozen. He kept telling himself that he was built for this. He had all the proper hardware and upgrades to prepare him for this mission. Standard scout soldiers are equipped with a bionic eye, a multi tool bionic arm, and genetic upgrades to be more resilient to extreme temperatures. His eye allowed him to see much farther than a default human, and could analyze parts of the environment. His eye also acted as a compass, so that he always knew what direction he was going in. His arm could function as a metal detector, a knife, and a screwdriver. His mission was to investigate an anomaly that had been detected by satellite. According to the coordinates he was given, his search was almost over.
It was morning when he found what he was looking for. The air and sand were still cool and the sun had just started to rise when he saw it. They towered over him. large deep brown objects with rough bodies, standing together like a battalion. Limbs reaching up to the sky with large clusters of green in defiance to the desolate landscape around it. It was a forest. He had only heard about them in stories, but he always had a hard time picturing them in his mind. He didn’t think that forests could even exist in a place like this. He thought that the only thing that this land could bring was death. But here it was, alive. He stood in awe for a moment, listening to the wind whisper through the leaves, and the faint songs of forest creatures. His curiosity overcame his fear of desecrating a sacred space. He stepped into the forest. Light trickled down through the canopy, gently touching his face, dancing across his skin. He wandered through the forest in a daze, still not really believing what he saw. Then he heard the sound of running water. Maybe this was just another cruel mirage and he was losing his mind. He found the stream just up ahead and with trembling hands, filled his bottle, and put a purifying capsule in it. He gulped it down eagerly, water streaming down his face. He had to force himself to stop and breathe. While he was refilling his bottle, he saw what looked like a piece of hull from a spacecraft. When he got closer he found a trail of debris leading him to a crashed spacecraft covered in thin wiry plants. Underneath the plants the ship was almost completely rusted out, but he could still make out a faded red white and blue flag and the words “Phoenix Dawn” . There was a large gaping hole on the side. Inside was a rusted docking station for a large machine, and several bags. Then, from the corner of his eye, a tree began to move. Or at least, he thought it was a tree at first. The dark, muddy colored appendage covered in moss had what looked like a shovel at the end of it. Rays‘s eyes followed the appendage up until he saw a rusted metal face.Ray looked into the robot's eyes and felt that it was looking back into his. They both sized the other up, trying to decide if the other was a threat. Ray couldn’t tell if the sound he heard from the robot was the groan of rusty joints or a territorial growl.
He recognized this model, it was a now obsolete Geo Shaper. The military used them often when claiming new territory. They were Robots built for terraforming, construction, and hauling heavy equipment. This model has interchangeable limbs for different tasks, and a massive build. Its head brushed the canopy, and its long arms were the same width as the trees around it. It had a long torso and short legs, so that it walked on all fours. That’s where the similarities ended though, this model had been altered. There were solar panels mounted to its back and a barometer and weather vane attached to its head, and it looked like most of its parts had been crudely repaired or replaced with pieces from other units. How long has it been here? The robot broke the stand still by reaching toward Ray. He cowered away but the robot ignored him, and reached behind him and grabbed a handful of small objects from one of the bags. The robot then turned and walked away. “Wait, come back!” “Where are you going?” Ray cried, following after the robot. They reached a clearing and the robot began systematically putting the small objects into the ground. They were seeds. “Did you plant all of these trees?”. The words had barely left his lips before a net shot out from behind the trees, entangling him and knocking him off balance. He couldn’t move, the material that the net was made out of was incredibly strong, and it seemed to constrict him. He looked up to find a crowd of people forming around him. The first thing that he noticed was that many of them were missing at least one limb. A few had prosthetics that looked like they were made out of machine scraps. The next thing he noticed was how many of them had eye patches, fake eyes, or just scars where their eyes should be, or big scars on the sides of their heads. “You’re deserters!” Ray said in disbelief. He didn’t think anyone who deserted actually survived.A wiry woman with piercing hazel eyes and a shaved head stepped forward and said “And you’re a threat. Tell us why we shouldn’t gut you and dump your body in the sand?” A few nods and agreements came from the crowd. A man with long unruly hair added “The military is probably already on its way because of him, we should get rid of him and get out of here before this place gets destroyed”. With a few more murmurs of agreement, a few pulled out knives and the crowd started advancing closer. “That’s enough” shouted an older man, stepping into the circle. The crowd stopped and fell silent. “You were like him once, have you forgotten already?”. The silence continued, as they looked at the parts of themselves that were missing. Remembering what was taken from them. Remembering what they took from others. They were ashamed. The hazel eyed woman looked up and said “Well, what are we going to do?” “We can't stay here, and we can't bring him with us, his tech makes him too easy to track and they are probably recording the data that his bionic eye is collecting.” “Besides, even if he removed his tech, how do we know that we can trust him?” The older man walked over to Ray, hoisted him over his shoulder, and carried him to the robot planting seeds in the clearing. “Well old friend, what do you think? Can we trust him?” He asked after placing Ray on the ground. The robot paused for a moment, staring into Ray's eyes.“I didn’t mean to! I… I didn't know!” Ray blurted out, tears welling up in his eye, “I didn't have a choice…… I've never had a choice”. The robot raised the sharp spade shaped tool at the end of its arm. Ray flinched as the Robot forcibly brought the spade down, grazing his mechanical arm and cutting the net that held him captive. The robot then reached down and pulled the net away, setting him free. “Well, You have a choice now” said the man with the unruly hair as he stepped forward. “It’s the choice we all had to make”. “You don't mean…?” ray said weakly, looking around at the missing appendages. “You can join us, or you can wait here for your friends to come get you. But if you come with us, their gear can't come with you.” 
Ray paused, considering the cost, then said “I can't go back”. He activated his arms screwdriver and jabbed it into his eye socket, prying out his bionic eye. He then ripped the screwdriver out and used it to unscrew the screws that kept his mechanical arm in place, then pulled the arm out of the socket. With one trembling hand and blood trickling down his face he said “I’m ready to go”. They could hear distant helicopters drawing near as they grabbed all the seeds that they could from the crashed vessel. As they were leaving, Ray looked back one last time and saw the robot waving goodbye. He felt the smooth outer shell of the acorn in his hand, imagining all of the forests that could grow from the handful of seeds in his pocket and said “We will bring life back to this wasteland”

It was a beautiful summer day of one hundred five degrees Fahrenheit, with thick smog covering nearly every inch of the sky. Naturally, it’s days like these when children should be out enjoying the weather. Or at least that’s what Jeffrey thought.
“Come on, John! Let’s go out and play Money Tree,” the boy said. Jeffrey’s friend John pouted and stayed planted on his plastic chair, spinning it around to face the other boy.
“I’m tired of playing Money Tree with you,” John admitted. “You don’t play the right way!” Jeffrey scoffed at this before grabbing his friend by his arm and pulling. 
“Trust me, I’ve got a good feeling about this one,” Jeffrey claimed. Reluctantly, John let himself be dragged outside where he could feel thick smoke entering his lungs with every breath. 
“At least the weather is nice,” John conceded.
“Right? Now check it.” Jeffrey grinned, showing off his flawless teeth, before reaching into his pocket. After a second of shuffling around, the eager boy pulled his pale hand out and opened it. 
Inside was a single seed. The seed was roughly the same shape and color as the synthetic Lima beans that John would see on his dinner plate every evening. John reached for the seed and Jeffrey pulled his hand back.
“Nuh-uh,” the smiling boy said. “Go get the shovel first and then we can get started.” John frowned at him but shook his head and started walking to his family’s shed. He opened it to find a museum of old tools. The tools were so rusty that his parents would have locked the shed up if tetanus hadn't been eradicated decades ago.
John went inside and grabbed the scoop shovel, carrying it back outside to where Jeffrey was laying down in the dirt. Footsteps crunching through dirt alerted the lazy boy and he sat up to greet his friend.
“Great, now you can start digging,” Jeffrey said. The shovel was dropped next to him in response.
“You do it this time,” John replied while scowling at his friend. Jeffrey grabbed the shovel and got back to his feet. He had the decency to look sheepish before handing the shovel back to his friend.
“You know me. I’m not as hands-on as you are in this game. I’ll help later, I promise.” John rolled his eyes at this but leaned over to pick up the shovel. He wasn’t too pleased about doing the work again, but he was eager to see how the tree would grow so he started digging.
After a couple of minutes of one boy digging with the other on his phone, a small hole, about 2 inches deep, was embedded in the ground. John dropped the scoop shovel and wiped the sweat off of his forehead. He held out a hand towards Jeffrey.
“Toss the seed here,” he said. In response, his friend put away his phone and pulled out the seed.
“Actually, let me work my magic here.” Jeffrey dropped the seed into the hole and began kicking dirt over it. Before long the seed was completely buried and what was left of the hole was replaced with a disturbed patch of dirt. “That was some hard work, right?” Jeffrey asked as he poured out an entire bottle of water on the earth. 
“Sure,” John replied. “Now we have to wait.” The two of them sat down and stared at where they had planted the seed. Throughout the next hour, the boys watched as the tree started to grow. The tree began as a thin, little twig, grasping for what little light it could find. When it found a small ray of sunlight slicing through the smog, it began to grow. The twig thickened, becoming a trunk, branching out like blood vessels from the heart. 
Green leaves shaped like bills started adorning the tree like ornaments. Eventually, the branches were overwhelmed with the leaves drowning the top of the tree in rich green. The money tree had bloomed.
The children stared at the tree with wide eyes and gaping mouths. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen one this big,” John said as he started plucking the leaves off of the tree.
“I think you’re right,” Jeffrey replied. “Must’ve been that super rare bottle of mineral water.” He sat back with a grin and watched John rid the tree of its leaves. 
After several minutes, the tree was stripped down to its trunk and branches. John was sorting through the pile of leaves, counting off how many they had. 
“Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred. We got a hundred leaves!” He yelled out. Jeffrey was sitting on the other side of the pile and began dividing up the leaves. His smile was infectious.
“This is awesome. One hundred has to be some sort of world record or something,” Jeffrey claimed. A minute passed. “There, seventy-five for me and twenty-five for you.” John raised an eyebrow at this.
“Why do you get more than me?” He asked.
“It’s obviously because I’m the leader,” Jeffrey replied in confusion. 
“But I did more work than you!” John began yelling.
“I helped, plus the seed was mine. I bought it with my allowance.” 
“I don’t care! This is why I hate playing Money Tree with you, you do this every single time.” As he said that, John began walking towards his house. 
“Wait, John! You’re the only one that wants to do this anymore.” Jeffrey ran to his friend. “Without you, I won’t be able to play Money Tree.” 
“Too bad, play it by yourself,” John said as he opened the door to his house.
“How about I teach you how to be a leader? Then you can buy your own money tree seeds,” Jeffrey offered. John was intrigued, the idea of buying his own seeds was a nice one. If he played Money Tree with his other friends then maybe he could get the most leaves.
“Deal,” John agreed and the two boys walked back to collect their respective piles.

“See you later, Mom! Me and Alfred are taking the steamboat up the Mississippi for an adventure!” Hurley said.
“Hold on there, Lee. It’s your birthday; you know the drill.”
Hurley slid his shoes off, kicked them across the kitchen, almost hitting his sister Marina. “Sorry,” he said as he stood in the door frame. His mother grabbed a pen from the junk drawer and walked over to the door.
“Amazing! You’ve grown an inch and a half since last year. At this rate, you’ll be taller than both me and dad by the time you’re a teenager.”
“You better watch out mom, I’m coming for ya!”
“Ok, you and Freddy have a responsible day out on the water in the canoe,” she said. Most parents would say, “Be safe,” but she knew being responsible was more encompassing and helped him grow into the fine young man she knew he could be.
“Mom, it’s not a canoe; it’s a steamboat. I’m going to teach Alfred all the terms to become a pilot like me so we can travel the world together.”
“Ok then, you and Fred enjoy your day on the steamboat. Oh, wait! I still need to take your birthday picture.”
Hurley smiled obediently and posed for the photo. “Can I go now, mom?”
“You can go. Remember to be safe; I mean responsible. Be back before dinner. I’m making your favorite.”
Hurley grabbed the sack lunch he had prepared and headed to the backyard.
The shed door squeaked as Hurley pulled it open. There she was, the canoe—I mean, the steamboat.
He grabbed the boat at the bow and dragged it towards the water access point. Once there, he went back and closed the shed door, as a responsible boy would do. He whistled for Alfred, grabbed his lunch, and headed back to the boat.
Alfred jumped in the boat and laid down at the bow. Just as Hurley was about to launch the boat, he remembered.
“Paddles! Al, we forgot the paddles,” he said. The mutt just looked at him. It was clear this was a human problem.
He ran and grabbed the paddles, launched the boat, and jumped in. It looked like they would tip over for a second, but he caught his balance and stabilized.
“We’re off, Al,” he said. The pup stood up and peeked over the front of the boat, his tail wagging.
“Leadsman! What’s our mark?” He asked. “Silly dog. That means you should throw over the lead line to see how far down the river bed is.”
Alfred was not amused. He kept looking ahead windward with the river’s mist hitting his face.
“Ok. I’ll do it myself.”
He pretended to throw over the weighted rope and slowly lowered it until he felt the bottom.
“Just what I thought. Mark Twain. That’s two fathoms, or twelve feet to you, Al. Looks like we’re good to go on our adventure now.”
Hurley tapped the engine bell to signal full speed ahead, and they were off.
“Ok, boy. It’s time for your first lesson. If you’re going to be a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi, you’ve got to know the basic terms,” he said.
Al looked at him, stuck his tongue out the side of his mouth, and listened to him attentively.
“First, you have the bow and the stern. That’s easy. That’s the front and back of the boat, in that order.”
Al gave him a bark.
“Second, you have the port and the starboard sides of the boat. Lots of people get these mixed up, so pay attention. The port side is the left side of the boat when you’re looking toward the bow or the front. Starboard is the right side of the boat. Got it?”
Al groaned a bit and looked at Hurley with his head tilted.
“Augh, it’s easy, Al. The port is the left side where you get on the boat. The Starboard is the other side. Starboard was originally called steer board. Since most people, unlike myself, are right-handed, it was on the right side.”
By this time, Hurley was starting to feel the work of his rowing. This was hard. He decided to take a few moments to rest and float along.
“What do you think so far, Al?” He asked. “There’s nothing like the cool water and the puffy clouds above. A guy could get used to this. One day, I will become a real captain and travel the world.”
“Oh no, Al! You forgot to do the most important job as a steamboat pilot—always be looking ahead for trouble, and trouble is ahead!”
Some forty feet ahead was a sandbar, and they were headed straight for it. He tapped the engine bell to signal full stop, but it was too late. The bow of the boat ran up onto the sandbar.
“Dagnabbit, Alfred! You’re supposed to be watching,” he said. He knew it was his own fault, but it felt better to blame Al.
Alfred barked as if to say, “Don’t blame me; I’m just a dog.”
“I guess our only option now is portage.” Hurley leaped out of the boat into the shoal and dragged the canoe over the sandbar. It took some doing, but he managed.
He jumped back in the boat and began rowing. He felt dumb about his mistake. Any pilot worth salt knows to watch out for sandbars on the Mississippi. A good pilot knows where every one of them is and communicates with other pilots to see how the river has changed since the last pass through.
“We also need to watch out for low bridges, Al,” he said. “It wouldn’t be good to rip the top of our boat off on the underbelly of a bridge.”
After paddling for a while longer, they saw a bridge ahead. He slowed down. It looked like it was going to be a tight fit. Slowly and meticulously, he navigated under the bridge. It seemed like it took a long time to pass under it, but in the end, they made it safely through.
“Whew. That was close, Alfred. You really pulled your weight on that one. I couldn’t have done it without you. At this rate, you’ll be a pilot in no time.”
Al jumped at Hurley’s lap and licked him in the face. Gross.
“I think it’s about time for some grub, don’t you, Al? Let’s jump in the skiff and row to the starboard bank for lunch. We’ll have to head ashore and find something cool to drink.”
He rowed to a small dock off to the right and tied up the boat. He grabbed his sack lunch.
“Come on, boy,” he said to Alfred. “Let’s go see what we can find to drink.”
Hurley and Alfred headed uphill from the dock. At the top, he saw a small gas station that was perfect.
“You stay out here. I’ll grab us a Dr. Pepper and some water.”
He entered the building and made his way back to the drinks. “Man.” he thought. “Dr. Pepper is expensive here. Sheesh. So is the water. I’m glad I brought some extra cash.”
He plopped down the drinks and waited for the man behind the counter to tell him the total. Instead, the man turned pale, like he’d seen a ghost.
“Are you Hurley Brown?” The man asked.
“Yeah. How do you know my name?”
“Are you the son of Charles and Jan from Anson Crest?”
“Yeah.” He said, confused.
The man was shaking. He slowly turned around the newspaper he had been reading. The headline read:
HURLEY BROWN MYSTERY STILL UNSOLVED
Ten years later and the trail is still cold.
The article showed the same photo his mother had taken a few hours ago. He was wearing the same clothes.
“What kind of prank is this?” Hurley asked.
“This is no prank, kid. You and your dog have been missing for ten years. Where have you been all this time?”
“I haven’t been anywhere. Look, me and Al have been on the steamboat all morning.”
“Steamboat?”
“Canoe.”
“Al?”
“Alfred, my dog. We only left the house a couple of hours ago.”
“Listen, kid. We better call your parents,” the man said. “Do you know your number?”
“Of course, I know my number; I’m not a child.”
“What’s the area code?”
“The what?”
“The area code. Let’s just call 911.”
In any other circumstance, Hurley would think hanging out in the back of a squad car would be cool, but he and Alfred were scared. Hurley wasn’t sure what was going on. He kept thinking this was a prank that was about to be over. Maybe some of his friends would pop out from around the corner and yell, “Gotcha!”
“We got ahold of your mom and the chief, and they’ll be here in a few minutes, kiddo,” the officer said. “Just hang here for a bit.”
When mom and dad got there, mom was bawling her eyes out. It looked like dad was about to break too. Mom hugged him so hard his back hurt.
Hurley’s Mom and dad looked different. Mom’s hair was now completely gray. Dad’s had patches of gray. They both had gained weight. They both had more wrinkles than he remembered. Dad was wearing a policeman’s uniform, which took Hurley by surprise.
They all jumped in the wagon to drive home. He thought it was weird that they brought along Marina’s babysitter until he realized the thirteen-year-old girl sitting next to him was his sister. He didn’t even recognize her. Last he saw, she was about three. It was all too weird.
“Dad, was me and Alfred really gone for ten years?” He asked.
“Yes. A lot has changed while you were gone,” he said. “Listen, I don’t know where you were, but I’m glad you’re back.”
“Mom? What do I do now? I feel like I’m on a different planet.”
“Truthfully, I don’t know,” she said. “We stick together, and we figure it out.” There was a profound loss in her eyes that he could not fathom.
Hurley sat back in his seat and looked out the window for the rest of the ride home. The town looked the same and not the same. There were new buildings and buildings that were missing. This world looked like his, but it wasn’t. 
After supper, he went to his room. Alfred was with him as he sat on his bed, trying to understand what was happening.
“Knock knock,” Marina said. “I’m glad you’re back, even if I don’t remember much.”
“Thanks. It’s good to be back, I guess.”
“Where were you?”
“I don’t know. All I know is me and Al left the house in the canoe this morning, and now we’re here.”
“You know how that sounds, right? It’s impossible. You had to have been somewhere for all that time.”
“I know how it sounds, but that’s what happened. I wish I knew what to say. Everyone keeps looking at me like I’m crazy.”
“I don’t think you’re crazy. I don’t know you well enough yet to know for sure,” she said and smiled at him.
“I think I just want to go to sleep. Maybe I’ll wake up tomorrow and find that this was just a random dream. This has been one very long Saturday.”
Hurley’s alarm went off. He was glad for a new day. He got ready for church just like any other Sunday and headed downstairs to see what was cooking for breakfast.
He was surprised to find that he was the first one up. Usually, mom and dad were already up waiting for him by now.
“Mom? Dad? Did I get up too early? I thought we would be leaving for church soon,” he said.
“Oh,” mom said. “I guess it is Sunday. Charles, wake up; we’ll be late for church.”
“Late for what?”
“Church!”
“Oh.”
The drive to church was awkward. The silence was finally broken when Marina asked where they were going. “Church,” Mom said. She just seemed more confused.
Finally, they saw the sign up ahead—First Anson Crest Church. They all spilled out of the car and walked up to the front door.
Mom looked at dad; he looked her straight in the eyes. It was as if they were speaking to each other without saying a word. Dad opened the door, and we all went in.
A greeter in the foyer handed dad a bulletin. “It sure is great to see you folks again. It’s been a while,” he said.
Dad said, “Good to be here, thanks.” He quickly moved on to get a seat at the very back of the auditorium.
Hurley looked around. He was sure this was the same church they went to last week, but it looked different. The pews were not the same color he remembered. The carpet was different. Most of all, he only recognized a few people.
After church was over, they went out to a cafeteria. They sat together and joked and laughed and had a great time. 
For a few minutes, Hurley felt like things were normal, just like old times. Problem was, for him, “old times” were just a few days ago. 
Days and weeks went by. Life became routine, but things never felt comfortable. It was like he was living someone else’s life. It wasn’t fair. 
Mom and dad were trying, but they didn’t look at him the same. They had moved on ages ago and were swept back from a painful loss they hardly knew what to do with in the first place. It was as if they feared loving him in case he was lost again. 
A year passed. It was once again his birthday. It was not an enjoyable year. All his friends had already graduated and scattered. It was weird that he and his sister were the same age. Even worse, his mother didn’t prompt him to get his height marked or take a birthday picture. 
He put on that shirt from the photo in the paper. It had become his favorite over the last year. It reminded him of how things used to be.
He grabbed his sack lunch and headed out.
“Come on, Alfred. Let’s go for a walk.” 
Alfred had been with him from the very beginning. He found comfort in that but still felt this new world had little to offer. Ten years had passed by and forgot to include him. He would never become a pilot and travel the world with such a lousy record. What kind of pilot loses ten years on a journey?
Hurly and Al found themselves back by the dock where they had left the canoe.
“We might as well take her back home, boy,” he said to Al.
Alfred tilted his head and whimpered. He jumped in the canoe and laid down at the bow, just like before. It seems Alfred agreed.
Hurley joined him. He untied the boat that had been sitting there for a year. Nobody wanted to mess with the boat of a missing boy and his dog.
“Let’s go!”
He grabbed the paddles, backed away from the bank, and began rowing towards home.
They slowly passed under the bridge as before, without drama. He was too old now for pretending. It had been over a year since he had read about Mark Twain and his adventures. He could hardly remember all the terms himself.
Up ahead, he saw a sandbar. No mistakes this time; he navigated around it just fine.
Another hour of rowing, and they’d be home. Alfred moved back and sat next to Hurley. He found it comforting. Somehow dogs know just the right time, and this was the right time.
He finally reached the access point to his yard. He and Al jumped out. Alfred ran on ahead toward the house. Hurley grabbed the craft’s bow and dragged it up to the shed. He opened the shed and pulled the canoe in. The door squeaked as he closed it.
“Back so soon?” His mom asked.
“Yeah, I just wanted to bring the canoe home.”
“You mean the steamboat?”
“Yeah, the steamboat,” he said. He looked up at her and began to cry. “Mom! Your hair!”
“Yes, I have hair, son. I promise I brushed it this morning. What has gotten into you?”
He was at a loss for words. “It’s just so pretty,” he said.
“If you say so,” she said. “You know, I swear you’ve grown another inch and a half since this morning. You need to stop having so many birthdays.”
“I feel older too.”
“I tell you what. Why don’t you get washed up and play with your sister while I work on supper.”
He went to his room and threw the remains of his sack lunch on the bed. He sat down, opened the bag, and pulled out the article clipping. It was still there. It did happen. But now he was home, and that future didn’t matter anymore; it was the past, and he had gained a year in a single day.
Maybe he wasn’t such a bad pilot. He realized his adventure was just beginning, and the whole world was waiting for him.
<|endoftext|>
Graphite marred the well-worn door frame. Edwin plopped little Micah in front of the lovingly graffitied frame and made the customary mark at the top of his head. With all the little darlings who’d passed through his home, he was running out of doorways. He gave Micah’s tiny head a tiny pat. 
Through a heavily mustached mouth, Edwin enthusiastically said, “Three whole inches! Right on track.”
Micah wiggled a gleeful dance as Edwin picked him back up and placed him in his cozy spot near the large glass window. His baby brethren greeted him with giggles and squeals. Early in the morning, the spot provided ample sunlight and a wide-open view of the backyard where Micah’s older siblings played. Edwin measured Morgan, Mariah, Marvin, and Mortimer one at a time. He always returned them to the spot under the window with a warm smile and words of encouragement.
Sun warmed the soft, squishy bed the five M’s wiggled on. A clear blue sky allowed cheerful rays of light to shine on them as they learned how their bodies moved and visually explored their new world. Soon enough, they’d be big and strong and able to join their family frolicking out in the backyard.
The backyard lay safely between the house and three gargantuan, wooden fence walls. Inside, the grass grew wild and tall. Large, leafy plants sprawled out in every direction. Bushy trees guarded the corners of the yard, vibrant and a haven from the heat. Lenore, Lucy, and Lem huddled together in the center of the lush wonderland. New to the outside, they still stumbled and took awkward, comical steps. However, after months rooted firmly indoors, the trio gladly fumbled around their newfound freedom. 
Somewhere near the shadiest - in more ways than one - bit of fence, Jewel, Jenny, Jericho, and Jeremiah played amongst the oversized foliage. Leaves provided cover as they hid from each other. Stalking bugs, and trying to prove they were all grown up. Even though they still had much more growing to do.
In a far corner, standing as straight and tall as possible stood Doreen, Dela, and Drake. They watched as their siblings played. They chittered back and forth and they dreamed of life outside the fence. They heard voices not belonging to them or Edwin beyond the barrier. They saw balls fly in the air and heard strange noises neither they nor Edwin could properly imitate. Gruff sounds, short and loud. Some high pitched, some low. Sometimes, when they pleaded, Edwin tried his best to make these sounds. The siblings loved his silliness. They broke their brooding nature and laughed raucously, but it wasn’t the same sound.
Edwin told them of life outside and why he forbade it. They knew the rules, the rhetoric, but their hearts rebelled. Alva, Astrid, Adam, and Alfie repeated Edwin’s words to the nearly grown trio, but in a way, only one of their own knew how to convey. Edwin loved them and cared for them, and they, in turn, loved him. But some things, only the siblings could teach each other. Only someone who lived through the same trials, the same thoughts and quandaries, battled the same urges, held the power to convince you to trust what you’re told. Especially when everything else in you strained against its cage, begging you to do the opposite. 
Corrine and Corra currently suffered one of those trials, in the glass house. Edwin called it their “quaran-time”. The D’s watched from afar, as they too would soon go through it. More time would pass before the L’s endured it and much more time before the M’s. Sure enough, though, each group braved their quaran-time. Corrine and Corra looked miserable. Not as many plants lived in the glass house, and no grass anywhere. The air stood hot and stiff with only a slight breeze where the roof sat a few inches above the walls. But they got more food and the A’s assured everyone that it wasn’t as bad as it looked. Plus, it was a time necessary for Edwin’s safety and for their maturity.
The sun rose high in the sky, radiantly shining down on the yard and all its inhabitants. Like clockwork, delicious smells flowed from the main house and into the yard. Near the window, the smell woke the tiny M’s, exhausted from play. The L’s sprang out of hiding and the D’s left their sulking behind. The C’s, frenzied with hunger but weak from the turmoil of rapid growth, clambered towards the glass house door. As always, the A’s ushered everyone to the long table on the back porch. With a practiced calmness, they saw that everyone was present and found a seat before taking their own. 
Heat stifled the house as Edwin cooked over the stove, frequently wiping sweat from his brow. Each passing day seemingly grew more laborious, but he never faltered. He loved his home and his yard, he delighted in cooking, and above all, he loved his little darlings. Nothing, no matter how tedious, how difficult, could unhinge that feeling.
Edwin loaded up tray after tray with foods small and large, hot and juicy. First, he brought crumbles of bacon and sausage to the tiny, watering mouths of the M’s. Next, he took three trays of sliced tenderloin, pork cutlets, and loaves of beef, all rare, to the long table. Lastly, a tray each went to Corrine and Corra, piled high with mounds of bloody steaks and ribs. He designed the glass house with a locked slot large enough to slide the trays through. As per routine, Corrine and Corra stood firm against the opposite wall as Edwin unlocked the slot and slid the food in. Once he secured the lock again, the pair shambled as fast as possible towards the meat.
Not long after, Edwin collected the trays and cleaned them before spending time with each age group. He checked their progress, their health, and participated in an activity of their choosing. The L’s preferred hide and seek while the D’s spewed forth endless questions. The sun, on the verge of starting its nightly descent, still shined strong, though Edwin did not feel the same way. He used to be able to play until dark, but well…times changed.
So he found a cozy chair and pulled the M’s close. They were nearly as tired as him but did everything in their power to convince him otherwise. He acted oblivious to their yawns and waning attention and convinced them to cuddle up as he read a story. The five curled up on their cozy bed and listened to an odd story about delicious piggies who they would not, for an unknown reason, get to eat.
Well before complete darkness, the M’s and Edwin drifted to sleep.
In the backyard, everyone else huddled together in the dying light. They always ended the day near the glass house. A constant glow emitted from a tiny sun Edwin called a lamp, and other devices kept the area “heatered”. The A’s watched over everyone as they settled in when a thump from the fence caught their attentions. The entire group immediately stopped their rustling and chatting and focused on the fence.
“Watch it!” they heard a strange voice shout.
“Shh!” came another voice, “That’s the weird place. Watch where you throw that.”
Despite the warning, a few seconds later a small disc floated over the fence. The siblings, consumed with confusion and curiosity, exchanged glances with one another. Doreen started towards the object when Alva cautioned her back.
“Now you did it!” a voice cried, startling the siblings.
“Stop whining,” came the disinterested reply, “Help me over the fence.”
Over the fence? The siblings murmured together. Sure the A’s could nearly see above the top, but not even they could go over it.
“No!” squeaked the opposer, “Mom said we need to go knock on a door to get permission.”
“This is quicker. Just help me,” the stronger voice demanded.
Soon, feet thudded against the fence followed by scratching and scrambling.
“Both of you help. You gotta boost my feet!”
Fingers, smaller and smoother than Edwin’s peeked over the top of the fence.
The siblings crept forward. The chill air stung, but the smell lured them. The A’s recognized the reality of Edwin’s lessons confronted them now. Time to practice what they learned. They’d grown up with lessons of resisting the urge. Now, with their first-ever real encounter, they didn’t know if they’d be able to help themselves. Feet scrambled on the wood as the kid hooked his armpits over the top. The siblings froze halfway to the fence, a macabre parody of red-light green-light. The boy swung himself over and dropped inside the yard.
“Ow!” he yelped, catching splinters on his way.
“What do you see?” a voice breathy with excitement asked from the other side.
The kid scanned the yard. With the high fence and the low sun, shadows shielded everything, “It’s just a bunch of plants. Like, a lot.”
“Lame.”
A tiny drop of blood trickled from his palm as he removed a sharp piece of wood. The teen looked around for his frisbee, and, eyes finding it, he moved with purpose. He bent down to pick it up and a loud rustling startled him. He jumped and looked around.
“Stupid,” he admonished himself, stamping down his fear, “it’s just a bunch of plants.”
He picked up his frisbee and turned to look for a way out. Curiosity gripped him though when he saw lights coming from the glass house. Inside stood two plants taller than he’d ever seen. Their stems swayed back and forth, and what appeared to be giant mouths snapped at the air. They looked like mammoth versions of the venus fly traps in his science class.
“Cool!” he breathed and walked toward the glass house. He pressed his hands against the glass and stared wide-eyed at the peculiar plants. They stood as tall as him and moved in unnerving ways, ways a plant shouldn’t move. The scene disturbed and fascinated him. Blood from his hand smeared the glass and the plants snapped forward again. Roots lifted out of the ground and gaping mouths filled with spindly, spikey, teeth-like objects bit at the glass. The boy leaped backward. His foot snagged a vine causing him to fall on his back. Tiny stings immediately nipped at his ankles. Thinking he landed in some thorns, he quickly attempted to stand up. More vines and piercing bits gripped his wrists and pulled him back down. Panic flooded him and he struggled to take calm breaths. Cold sweat distorted his vision as he struggled to see what held him. It's only plants, he kept telling himself. Get a grip and just tear them off.
However, smaller versions of the glass house plants swarmed him, covering his legs and chomping down. He twisted and squirmed, managing to get to his knees. Suddenly, his vision turned completely black. Light shone in his periphery, but directly before him remained a mystery. A shadow against the dying light. Slowly, his eyes focused on a deep green, stripy stem, thicker than his torso. He followed the stem upward, tilting his head back until he could go no further. Staring down at him, eyeless and menacing, was the absolute largest foliage he could imagine - besides a tree.
The carnivorous plant lowered her head - pretty much all mouth - to meet his. Alva let loose an otherworldly cry, high shrieks mixed with low undulations. His eyes met a gaping maw, blood red and lined with teeth the length of his forearm. Spittle flew out from sacks lining the fold in the back of her mouth, landing on the boy. His skin burned as his wheezing breaths finally gave way to a primal scream, the only thing he could do as Alva and her siblings swarmed their fresh dessert.

Recording found on Earth's surface, M768, first landing since the Event
9th Deimos, M38. (Earth calendar 2107)
Today dawned, as it always does, with a red sky.
Today I am eight years old, Martian years that is, which, for any earthlings, is about fourteen Earth years and this the first entry in a record that I promised my parents I would keep. They called it. They called it. Sorry, things have got a little emotional. You see. No, of course you don’t. I know what it is called. It’s a diary and they wanted me as, what they called me, a true Martian to tell the story of our colony or settlement. Damn it, I am supposed to be a big girl now, not a cry baby. But, oh, all I want to do is curl up and scream. Why me! But more than that why them! Why my mom and pop? Why not someone else’s? And before you say that’s selfish well I’m eight and I want my mom back. So there!
38th Deimos, M38. (No point in using the Earth calendar anymore. Earth isn’t there.)
Sorry, its been too long. Pop told me you should put an entry in a diary every day. Even when not a lot happens. Trouble is an awful lot has been happening and none of it good. I only started this barely 30 days ago. I don’t know, can you write about the past in a diary?
39th Deimos, M38.
I’ve been talking to people, everyone I could find who’d talk to me. Everyone is still in a state of shock. No one knows if we can even survive, let alone build a future but the older ones seem to think we may just manage it. It was always expected that the supply ships from Earth would boost our own developing food production. Now we only have ours to live on. I’m hungry just worrying about it.
41st Deimos, M38.
Missed another entry. So tired. I had to spend hours in the hydroponics dome yesterday. I’m not the only one, everyone is being pulled in. One of my teachers, yes we do have schooling, mostly by computer, told me we must triple our production if we are to avoid disaster and that means no escape.
The teacher also said I should write about the past. At least that bit which has led us to where we are.
Perhaps I should introduce myself. My name is Phoebe, Phoebe Larsen, born in the 27th year of the settlement which sits in the shadow of Mons Olympus, the year 2093 back on Earth. Wait, that’s the pressurisation alarm! Breathing mask, where the hell is it? Oh that’s it. Sorry that was a bit of a scrawl.
Memo to me : best not to try writing when dragging safety gear on.
44th Deimos, M38
Three days since I botched up. Turns out the alarm was a drill and I failed it. A dozen of us didn’t react quick enough to “live”. Should’ve chucked you aside diary! I won’t make that mistake again. Three days! Three days hard labour working in the sewage farm! That seems so unfair, I’m eight not eighteen and I’m on my own. Siobhan Pieters, the Mars commander told us straight. We can’t afford to lose anybody. The thousand or so humans on Mars are maybe the last unless we can find the Earth. Find the Earth? Is she joking? Anyway, example made of all twelve of us.
45th Deimos, M38
I know I keep saying that I need to write something about what has happened. Trouble is no-one really knows. It all seems to have started during the last conjunction. That’s when the sun is between Earth and Mars. It doesn’t last long but there is a period when we cannot communicate with each other. Damn it, I keep saying it like it’s any different to now. I mean it was. One minute comms worked then the sun got in the way and for a while nothing but then “bingo!” – I’m not sure why that word but it’s what I heard used – and comms would be back. Only this time, well, there wasn’t a “bingo!”. Just static, no links at all with Earth or Lunar.
At first the comm techs spent hours trying to find the fault. I mean it had to be a fault at our end didn’t it. Finally the adults agreed. Something was wrong on Earth. And then they dropped the bottle. They couldn’t even find Earth. Where Earth should have been was just, well, they didn’t say what exactly and that’s when us youngsters knew that our parents were in a panic and scared. I mean really scared. Scared shitless! Ooops! I’m not supposed to use words like that but no-one’s going to row me – not now anyway. And I mean that’s how they were. Me and mom and pop just hugged each other for what seemed hours.
Then they told me! Oh no. No! No! I thought I’d got over that bit back when I started this diary. Now you’re going to have to wait, can’t write on wet.
49th Deimos, M38
Told you you’d have to wait. Only we’ve been given different work to do. I know. I know. You probably thought child workers went away centuries ago. Yes. Well. When you are just looking to survive lots of things go by the book. I mean at least it’s not dangerous like going down chimneys (not sure what a chimney is or was) which wasn’t clever and I mean not dangerous as long as you follow the rules. Even us eight year olds have had the risks that Mars poses drummed into us until they are second nature, maybe even more so than for those who came from Earth.
Now look! That was on 28th Phobos (M37). There had been agreement. A ship had to be sent back to where Earth was, or is that should have been? and Mom and Pop were going to pilot it. And they weren’t going to take me! We rowed, I mean rowed. I threw the biggest tantrum I had in years but it was no use. They meant it when they said they had to go and no-one else was better qualified. And they wouldn’t buy it that someone less qualified would be better. They said they’d only be gone a few months. They said! They’d keep in touch, they said. I think I made Pop a bit mad because he told me then that I needed to GROW UP. I mean me! I’m eight - that’s fully grown up.
So, I watched their shuttle lift from the surface on the way to one of our craft in orbit. Once there they had to reboot - why boot? – the ship which like the others capable of carrying us had been mothballed – omg that’s another term I don’t know the origins of. It took forever, well several hours anyway, before the ship left orbit.
Most of the way we did talk each day for a few minutes but it got more depressing as time passed. At the halfway stage Mom admitted that they couldn’t find Earth. There was also no sign of Mercury. Then there was no Mom and Pop. Oh, no. I’m at it again. They told me it’d get easier. Liars!
3rd Europa, M38
Four days, sorry, I’ve been in a cold funk. I can’t see what happened. Last message said that they were wrong. There was something where Earth should have been – a swirling sphere of energy? No-one understands it. We can’t see anything from here. No telescopes, only what is on another of the ships like Mom and Pop’s. Oh and no-one even checked on me these last days. Or at least I don’t think so, could they be snooping? I’m mad if they have and I’m going to find out.
4th Europa, M38.
They did check on me and, now I’m red faced, I told them to go forth and multiply and leave me alone. I don’t think I used that many words! Someone told me to let it out, they knew I needed to grieve. It didn’t help but I’d somehow got a hangover. Don’t know where that came from. Ouch, my head hurts even now.
5th Europa, M38
I’ve been told to GROW UP – AGAIN! Seems my exploit with some alcohol – still don’t know where I got it – is common knowledge. The Commander warned me that she couldn’t let anything else go. “Fancy the sewage works again, do I?” Actually everyone has to do a shift there once a month but as a punishment exercise – you don’t want it, trust me.
Anyway, maybe I will have to, at least, make it look as if I have – GROWN UP that is.
There’s going to be a second attempt to find Earth. They know where the danger point is, they think, but not why. They know there is something there but not what. So I’m going on that trip whether they want me to or not. I can co-pilot, Pop taught me on my tablet. Heck, I could pilot it if I had to. I’m the best at science in my class group. Why wouldn’t they let me? And I’m still little – I won’t use as much oxygen or food. And if they don’t agree they might just have a stowaway!
14th Europa, M38
We launch today!!!!
Yes, I know. Another nine days with nothing in the diary. It seems that not everyone is in favour of this trip. They see it as a waste – another ship gone. Well Siobhan pointed out that there is at least another six ships in orbit and just when did anyone really think they would be needed? Then she looked for two volunteers. The meeting was part physical, part video-link and I’d decided to keep a low profile until I knew who would be going. I thought there would be dozens wanting to go and I waited, and waited, and waited, but no-one did anything.
After forever, I slowly put my hand up and said “I want to go.” I expected to be laughed at. All they’d see, I thought, is a little girl wanting to go on a trip she didn’t understand. I gritted my teeth. I’m NOT little. I’m EIGHT and I understand as much as anyone. But they didn’t. Laugh I mean.
A second voice came. “So we are put to shame by a young woman who has lost her family but still wants to help.” It was Jan, a friend of my Pop who knew me. “You still want to go, Phoebe? Then I’ll be your co-pilot.”
Siobhan didn’t look too happy but agreed to consider us as crew. Two days, two long days later she agreed to let us head out. When I think about it maybe me going was one less headache for her. So we’ve had seven days to prepare and now we go!
15th Europa, M38
I didn’t realise how boring space travel is. We left orbit yesterday. Mars is shrinking as we boost away. A day of boost and then we will coast.
16th Europa, M38.
Jan is making me practice all the drills over and over. He says you can’t get perfect but the closer the better. It does pass the time.
17th Europa, M38.
Nothing new.
32nd Europa, M38.
I know, I know. I have loads of time and could write for hours but….there’s nothing to write about. Actually, if you look closely at the past fifteen days each has a ditto sign – that’s 18th to 31st all the same as 17th.
But now we are closing on the danger point. We can see where Earth should be and its just as Mom and Pop said. All we can see is a ball of energy. There’s a trail of it that is linked to Lunar. But what it is or where it came from we don’t know. It looks scary but at the same time there is a beauty to it.
34th Europa, M38.
Yesterday was the worst day of my life. I was about to take over from Jan at the controls after a rest, not sure you could call it sleep. The flash left me blinded for a moment, afterimages everywhere. Jan wasn’t as lucky. Whatever it was, it left him blind and paralysed. He died in my arms hours later.
Today is today. I have told myself I have to go on. We have to know what has happened. The instruments recorded a flash that came, not from the energy ball around Earth if that is what it is, but from a point near Lunar. Somehow as the moon orbits it is attracting energy from the sphere and every so often this discharges in a single moment as a flash. It’s as if the two bodies are acting a bit like a pulsar just not as powerful. I mean a flash from a pulsar would simply have fried the entire ship but I can’t find any physical damage.
The guys on Mars are telling me that I should return and not take any more risks but I really don’t think that they are thinking it through. What is the source of this energy? If it increased then Mars might be at risk. I just realised that I am as stubborn as they used to call me.
35th Europa, M38
I have been watching the energy swirl. Am I being daft? I think it might be getting less violent. There was another flash. It wasn’t in this direction but the whole sphere seemed to dim – a little and for a moment at least.
36th Europa, M38
I shared my thoughts with the scientists, back home, monitoring the ship. Ouch! I just smacked my arm against the wall. Must have been another flash. Missed the ship but caused it to rock in the wake of the energy flux. Gosh, I didn’t know I knew so much. That sounded good didn’t it!
They were quite upbeat about it but we do wonder if there is anything left of the Earth. Lunar surface looks as smooth as a snooker ball. (Note: if survive this I must find out about snooker.)
38th Europa. M38
Decided that I will continue towards the Moon. See what has happened there. If, I don’t get fried, of course. Siobhan came on-line today. I think she was questioning my sanity. Something about being NUTS! But in the end she just said ”god speed” and there’s me trying take the approach slowly!
41st Europa, M38
Getting closer now but the flashes have been increasing. None have got too close but, believe me, I could do with some sleep.
46th Europa, M38
Flew past the Moon, funny the nearer I am the more I call it Moon instead of Lunar. It isn’t like the pictures – the craters have gone and it does look smooth like an eggshell and that’s a better description than a ball of any type. It has been distorted into an oval. Oh, shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What’s happening?????????????
47th Europa, M38
Sorry. Language, Phoebe, language. But I think it warranted it because now I’m going find out where the Earth is. What do you mean? Why have I changed course? Oh, I did miss that bit. As the ship rounded the narrow end of the oval Moon something hit, knocking us off course and now I’m falling towards the energy sphere. Oh and it killed the engines. I’ve got life support but nothing that will let me change where I’m going. I reckon I’ve a day before I reach there. A day before I probably get roasted.
Siobhan came on line via a secure beam, at least that is what she said it was. She told me about something in the meds cabinet. A quick end she said if it became too bad. When I said I wanted to see it through whatever she got quite emotional. She wished me well and then I think the tears became too much for her. I didn’t cry this time. After all I’ve had to GROW UP and big girls don’t cry.
48th Europa, M38
Only a few hours away now. Mom and Pop, don’t be mad but I think I am going to join you soon. My instruments suggest the energy flux has a temperature of over a thousand degrees. If it is as thick as it seems then I can expect melt down in about six or seven minutes.
Funny how calm I feel now I am committed. They said that. Body and mind see no point in wasting energy fighting the inevitable.
48th Europa, M38
Here we go. Guess we'll never know how or why. Goodbye everyone. Sizzling now……
49th Europa, M38
Oh my! The energy swirl was quite thin. It’s like it has just surrounded the Earth in a cocoon. Somehow I’m down on the surface. Trouble is the surface is like the Moon. Smooth as if it has been cleansed of everything. I hit water or perhaps steam which is why I’m still breathing – for the minute. But there isn’t anything else. All life has been extinguished. I don’t know how or why but the sky. Oh my god the sky. I’d read about the Northern Lights, the aurora borealis. But, wherever here is, the sky is lit by colours as different from the sky of my home as it could be.
50th Europa, M38
Goodbye again. My ship is slowly sinking and there’s no air to breathe. I’ve got Siobhan’s tablet. I think I will need it soon. It’s getting too hot. Mom, Pop is that you? I’m sorry my diary didn’t work out as you wanted……..

This story contains broaches the subject of both rape and child sex abuse from the point of view of the victim.
Today, we shall take our magical spyglass and put it to our eye. The eye I speak of is our third one, our spiritual one, the one, that those of us who are in true tune to as creators, allowing us to see parts of a cosmic whole. There are writers out there, who don't use that eye. One can tell when one comes across one of those because they write using Neural-Linguistic Programming to manipulate the reader for a personal agenda. (I would hazard that in some way, shape, or form, they are on the Illuminati payroll. Good for them. Their eventual wage will be death.)
Dear Reader, caress my words with your mind as we shuffle through the myriad of creatures dancing to their own rhythm in the depths of my psyche. Let us scroll through and find the character we seek.
Nope, not Josh. Josh, white and in his mid 20's, has a large shovel, bent over, digging a hole. His oppressors stand up, in line behind him, with weapons pointed. They have the (sometimes the m is silent) masses jeering at him. Look at the glow on Josh's face from the sweat. Observe that mad grin. Did you catch the glint in his eye?
Let us scroll through a bit more of the characters cavorting in my imagination.
Betsy isn't who we are after either. Yes, Betsy is kneeling on one of those luxury gardening kneepads. I would place our dark-skinned Betsy at about 80. Watch her unfold that beautiful bulb (species unknown) from the golden cloth. With care, she buries it in the small hole that she made. With soft hands she replaces the dirt, patting the ground even. Isn't she wonderful at what she does?
The next scene flips through my mind.
This one is dark. It is nighttime. Clouds scuttle across the horizon. Stars peep here and there only to be shielded again. Where is the moon? Oh! There it is. The clouds part, avoiding it.
What else is in this scene?
There, on the ground, kneeling on bare knees is Salvadora. Salvadora is of mixed heritage, a multi-national, and in her 40's. With dirt-encrusted nails, she scrabbles at the hard-packed earth. Minutes pass. She makes no dent.
Hours pass. It is the motion of the moon that keeps us abreast of time. Salvadora continues to grapple with the ground.
The moonlight strikes the few scratches Salvadora has made. Blood seeps from her fingertips, drenching the earth. Soundless tears flow, softening the ground.
Let me adjust my spyglass. Where is Salvadora at in her own mind? What is this poor creature thinking? Perhaps I shall use some of my author's telepathy to eke out meaning to her senseless actions.
Memories from the past float through her upper mind.
Sexual abuse from her father, brother, mother, and maternal grandparents cascade.
“Where is their karma?” she sobs verbally. “Where is my justice people keep telling me is coming?”
There was violence, torture, pain with some of the crimes. Her mother used to get great joy from inserting laxatives in the derriere. Her mother's smile gave it away.
Her father groomed her for sex before 5. He would leave the toilet door open, inviting her in when he was using it.
Her brother that didn't touch her, he took explicit photos. He always had a lot of money whenever he took these photos.
Her brother and his wife, she stayed with them when she was 9. They would have dinner parties, with her as the entertainment. There were also trips to nude beaches where they insisted she is naked.
Her maternal grandparents: the grandmother turned her back as her grandfather would rape her with his hands or... never mind. She was 10.
Salvadora broke that train of thought before the thoughts overwhelmed her.
Yet these criminals have more money than she does. They have had plenty of everything. Society accepts them. Does society know their evil secret?
Salvadora has nothing.
Memories from a distraught adulthood stream through her consciousness.
Her first husband. He pimped her out. There is no nice way of saying such evil. He destroyed her. He used her as a punching bag, unable to control his temper.
Her second husband. He did the unforgivable. He touched her children.
Both men went on to live abundant lives while she struggled for every dollar.
Then there were rapes. Multiple rapes by multiple assailants. Some of the rapists even wore uniforms. These are men were are programmed to trust. They abused their authority in her case. Some rapists were hardened criminals. Salvadora should have known better to give people a fair go when no one ever gave her an equal opportunity.
These men never received their karma.
Many, many beatings, from the many narcissists she had been foolish enough to allow into her life. Beatings that left her crippled and scarred. Even with physical evidence, they rarely got charged, and even when the proof was there beyond a reasonable doubt, they never got convicted.
Evidence that karma isn't real. Proof that justice, divine or human, does not exist.
Salvadora lost what little she had.
She had no children, no money, no future.
The world called her names and accused her of doing things that she didn't do. Society protected the perpetrators, the rapists, the wife beaters, the pedophiles. They persecuted her relentlessly.
Salvadora wept.
She would never return to doing any of the things those evil people had groomed her to do.
For more than 2 years she had followed Jesus faithfully. Salvadora read her Bible. Salvadora prayed. She sowed positive behaviour into her life. This had nothing to do with the existence of karma. It had proved that it didn't. If karma existed she would have money and a family and a place in society.
Salvadora sowed positive behaviour, right action, correct thoughts because she had suffered for her entire life and did not want to suffer for eternity.
Some of the men she had been with had killed her, not permanently. She had seen the other side. Salvadora understood the soul was eternal.
If the world had accepted her, she might have been inclined to sin, had she benefited from it. She noticed that a lot of people did the wrong thing, deliberately, without punishment. She understood, that in her Christian way of thinking, these people had the 'Mark of the Beast' in their soul.
It was obvious to Salvadora that she didn't. It was vital, then, for Salvadora to work for her salvation, sowing the seeds of righteousness into herself so that she could reap eternal peace.
Moonlight glinted on a tiny circular object between her knees. A solitary teardrop splashed onto it. A green tendril shot forth from it, penetrating the ground with ease where her struggling could not. Within moments the seed disappeared, following the tendril into the ground.
Salvadora remained unaware.
A thin twig burst from the ground. With rapidity, it surged upwards, stretching forth branches from its sides. Unnaturally, the branches encircled Salvadora. 10 spheres of light, each different in hue, appeared on the ends of the branches. Each sphere overlapped into Salvadora's body.
The final sphere blossomed above the crown of Salvadora's head. It was a bright white. A thin white fibre reached from above the sphere to end at a point undisclosed in space. It expanded beneath the sphere into her skull. Everywhere it touched other fronds appeared in her skull, all unfurling at once. It looked akin to a lotus flower.
Salvadora tilted her head back, staring with sightless eyes into the full moon. Illumination flowed from the giant orb, tinted with a touch of the sun, into her retina. Golden luminance coursed from beneath the lotus flower in her skull, into her midsection, where the 5th sphere up, was.
Beneath that, the darkness from the planet seeped in to colour the sphere, 2nd from the bottom was. The branch it dangled on was in her groin area, coloured murky indigo. After that, the energy went to the colours of a summer forest floor, littered with leaves of differing colours. The bottom-most sphere overlapped her feet and the earth.
Salvadora slumped, losing consciousness.
Where our heroine went from there, I do not know. There are not words, nor adjectives beautiful enough, even with a thesaurus to describe everything I saw within and around her. It felt sacrilegious, spying on her like that.
Perhaps, dear Reader, you will enlarge on her story. Maybe you can bring her the justice she deserves and ensure that those who perpetrated the evils she suffered, pay the price in karma. Or maybe, we just leave her from here. She seems determined, does she not, to reap eternal peace?
In order for that to occur, she must sew the seeds of righteous behaviour, and right thought, regardless of circumstances so she finally gets the reward she deserves.
NEVER THE END
<|endoftext|>
The waves collected the bioluminescent algae into a chaotic society of billions. They churned in a perfect mass with enough darkness in between to still show each individual life form. A single figure stood ankle deep in the swirling light. Ceremonial robes locked under the weight of the water as it wicked upwards. His eyes were a black mirror to the glowing sea.
It was time. It was the end of an era and the dawn of a new one. A time of forced celebration and more than a few dissenters disappearing into the night. It is quite the ask to expect an entire civilization to die willingly for a faith that was starting to lose its hold on the masses. Undeterred, the priest chanted and his words twisted through the crowd until they echoed against the rocky cliff.
A procession of naked women carrying small handfuls of earth in delicate cupped hands. Their breasts and bellies painted with intricate patterns that shifted with each step. Each woman was lost in the world that existed in her hands. They could focus on nothing else but carefully bringing the sprouted seeds safely to their destination. The path had been so carefully cleared of any obstacles that could be tripped over.
So many of the caretakers went blind and faith alone was not enough to offer recompense. There was so little light in their world that their eyes could not take the brilliance of the Solaar without permanent damage. It was the only form of true light in the world besides the distant stars. They had buried it deep under the earth in twisting caverns. It was needed for the seeds to sprout.
Being blindfolded and doing it by touch was simply not an option with life so precious. By the time the seeds sprouted their eyes were too far gone to see the riches that they had amassed with their sacrifice. Their wombs were kept empty in order to give all of their nurturing energy to their charges.
One of the women kept walking as the others stopped. She was more sure footed than the rest despite being just as blind. Her hair was tangled and freely listened to the wind. There were no gems and intricate chains adorning the strands and keeping them in place. The young seedling in her hands was different than the others. The roots had dug their way into her flesh just enough to be secure. The plant had become a part of her. She walked without hesitation into the water and faced the high priest.
The chanting that had been going on without rest for hours stopped. The dark mirror of his eyes reflected in her own. She could now see. He encircled his hands roughly around hers. The crowd gasped thinking that the tiny life had been crushed. Few knew what was to happen during this part of the ritual. He gently let go of her hands and pulled her close as she clutched the small life to her chest. The two bodies slowly became darker until it hurt to try and look at them. The shadow forms merged into one.
The naked women kneeled in unison. Many with dignified silent tears falling as their sight returned one by one. The dark form of the high priest and priestess had pulled all of the light from their exhausted bodies and it had also healed. They laid down their burdens into intricately carved rock that had been carefully placed just out of reach of the waves. The soil blew away in the wind. The roots of the seedlings whispered their way through the design until the rock was living. A kind of awe swept through the crowd. And then the fear came. There was no voice to quiet or calm the people. The priest was silent.
This is the end of this age he had told them all of their lives. The wars have all been fought, the peace and plenty had all been had. The teachings that had built a strong society had crumbled over time despite the truth they brought. There was no singular event that had deemed the world ready to end. The waves of greed and violence were followed by gluttony and a weakening of the whole. They had pulled themselves back from the brink so many times with the kindness of a few leaders that stepped forward just when they were needed. But the cycle still repeated. Closer and closer together to a final resting place. There was no more growth or change. This was the age of darkness and in the end the women huddled against the cold stone. Not for comfort, but for the unchanging nature they knew.
There was no way to know how much time had passed. The stars were still and did not move as they should to mark the hours. The water of the tide did not retreat. The people were frozen in resignation, clutching to each other but getting no comfort from the act.
Slowly, ever so slowly, the world took on a faint glow. First the blue of twilight. Except that they have never seen twilight. The Solaar was streaming through the cracks in the earth that had never been there before. It had happened silently with no shaking of the ground. It was beautiful at first. The children played in the wisps of light. The parents did not even tell them to stop.
The cocoon of darkness protected the high priest and priestess as the rest of their people perished. They had one final task to complete. They must shield the plants while the Solaar broke free. Too much at once would kill the fledgling new life that would bring forth the next age. They emptied their energy and life’s blood into procreation.  The darkness grew and diffused as it shielded the rocks that hosted the new ones. There must be shade before the first tree can provide it. Their lovemaking ebbed and flowed, allowing just enough light to filter through. The life that they had held between them broke through the darkness. It carried nothing of them beyond their will for it to be so.
<|endoftext|>
An immense rectangular prism, silver and featureless, perched on a cliff overlooking a tumbling river. The prism, called the Center for the Defense of Planet 808, glowed faintly in the growing light of the deeply golden horizon; the river reflected the bright windows of the towering white buildings on the far bank. 
On the face of the prism that looked away from the river and towards the promise of a rising sun, an invisible door slid open and a young woman emerged. Dressed in the charcoal uniform worn by the 808 Defense Force, dark hair smoothed into a practical ponytail, she set off along a stone path. It was only a few hours into the Thousand Mile City’s wake cycle, but Amber had just been released from her shift. She walked quickly, for she was barely in time for the sunrise celebration, where she was meeting her boyfriend, Denis.
Sloping gently away from the Center, the path was lit with strings of white lights that gleamed off of the silver-barked, smooth trunks of the solaxis trees along the edges. The trees’ rhomboid leaves, which ranged in color from sky to byzantine blue, formed an arching canopy over the walkway. Amber plucked a leaf and chewed it as she walked, savoring its slight sweetness. The leaves of the solaxis tree soothed nerves, and she was feeling jittery. The sun’s reappearance after 278 sleep cycles was a traditional time to propose, and she and Denis had been seriously discussing engagement. 
Amber felt its calming effects nearly immediately. The many uses of the solaxis tree, like the shimmering, resilient garments made from the bark’s fiber, made it extremely popular among the residents of 808. That’s why no one minded when, upon being introduced at the beginning of the most recent long night, it had taken to the planet’s rocky soil and spread quickly throughout the city. Not to mention its ethereal, alien beauty.
The solaxis trees were a gift from the planet Nin, which 808 trailed around the sun like a gray, desolate shadow. Gray, because 808 was as rocky and barren as Nin was lush and verdant, and desolate, because while Nin supported a thriving population, 808’s life was contained within a single city stretched along the riverbank. The river, borne from a frozen volcano and eventually fanning into a dried-up delta, was the planet's only water source. Thus, the Thousand Mile City grew longer and longer, but never wider.
Amber began to hear the din of the crowd gathered to watch the sunrise, and she quickened her pace in anticipation. As the highest point around, the tiered platforms stepping down from the hill had always been a popular spot to celebrate the return of the sun, but this time it had the added draw of being the site of the Bright Future Planetary Friendship Garden, where the solaxi had first been planted by Nin delegates. 
Denis was waiting for Amber at the entrance to the garden, where the path widened into a grassy platform with solaxi spaced several meters apart. He leaned down to greet her with a kiss.
“I saved us a good spot on the top tier,” he said. He was wearing the uniform from his engineering job at the ladus mine, but unlike Amber, he was about to start his shift, not finishing. His impending departure loomed in the back of her mind, the only shadow on this golden morning.
Even so, Amber couldn't help but feel festive. Groups of friends and families picnicked on blankets spread between the solaxi, and Amber noticed that one tree cradled a young boy in its lower branches. The couple joined the celebrators sitting on the edge of the tier, where a stone border marked the drop-off. They dangled their legs over the side and took in the view of the vast, arid plain stretching into the fiery horizon. 
“Have you seen those buds before?” Amber asked, pointing down at the tops of the solaxi on the tier below them. Pale pink buds nestled among the blue leaves, and she was sure that they were new. 
“I don’t think I have,” Denis said thoughtfully, “Maybe they’re a daytime thing.”
“Must be,” Amber replied, squeezing his hand and smiling. The idea of still more beauty and possible uses to discover from the solaxis trees made the onset of the long day even more exciting. 
Denis squeezed back. “Look, it’s starting!”
As thin as a single leaf of paper, the edge of the sun was just visible on the horizon, growing at an imperceptible rate. It would take all of this wake cycle and the next for the full circle to show itself. 
A hush fell over the garden, and as one, the people reached their palms up and forward to greet their star. The light was luxuriously golden; it gave a precious quality to everything it touched, especially the solaxi, whose metallic bark could have been dipped in liquid gold. A sweetness filled the air and Amber saw that the buds had opened, turning into delicate six-pointed flowers that were releasing a pale pink mist.
An admiring gasp went up from the crowd, and Amber turned to Denis to make sure that he noticed. But he was looking at her instead, vulnerability and joy on his earnest face, using his soft voice to ask her a question. 
She didn’t know what she had been nervous for. As she opened her mouth to give her enthusiastic yes, yes, of course yes, the moment was cut by a thud and a scream from behind. The couple twisted around to see what was the matter. 
The boy had evidently fallen from the tree; he was on his back in the grass. And he was far, far too still.
“He’s not breathing!” his mother shrieked, crouched alongside her son, “Somebody help, do something!” 
Amber scrambled to her feet. First aid and a cool head in a crisis had been trained into her bones at the Defense Center. But before she could reach the child, the mother spasmed and fell onto her side, struggling to breathe. 
Amber stopped in her tracks. She slid open a panel on her Defense Force-issued bracelet, exposing a fingerprint-activated emergency button. She pressed it with her index finger, sending an official signal to the Defense Center that something in the garden was going very wrong.
“Stay back!” she called out authoritatively as others began to approach the mother and child in concern, “Something weird is happening.” 
The would-be helpers began to back away, but not before a slim young man fell to his knees, gasping desperately. 
Denis was at Amber’s side. “Maybe it’s bad air,” he suggested.
This seemed unlikely to Amber. Toxic fumes from volcanoes did make their way into the city every once in a while, but their distinctive stench was notably missing. Unless… Amber eyed the pink mists filling the space between the trees.
“Don’t breathe the mist!” she shouted while pulling off her jacket and using it to cover her nose and mouth. “Get away from the trees!” 
Amber tugged at Denis’s pullover, and he hastily followed her lead. Laser-focused, all too conscious of the people collapsing around her, she did a quick visual and mental survey of the area, trying to locate a place the mist would not be able to reach. But seeing the pink clouds billowing up from the tier below and the swiftly worsening visibility, she realized that the Defense Center, with its air filtration system to keep out volcanic fumes, was their only chance. 
She took a deep breath and briefly removed the cloth from her mouth to shout, “Go to the Center!”
Grabbing Denis’s hand, Amber began to run. Those who were able followed. At the quickest pace she could manage without leaving Denis behind, it was a run of barely more than a minute, but it was the longest of her life, and every time she looked over her shoulder, it seemed that less people were behind her. When the couple finally reached the Center, Amber scanned her bracelet and the door slid open, letting them and a group of around fifteen others that had managed to keep up into the airlock. There were figures emerging from the pink fog, but they were too far away, for now. Amber pressed the button to close the door and the group waited a tense twenty seconds for the air to decontaminate before a second sliding door allowed them into the lobby. 
“More coming, let them in, let them all in,” Amber gasped to the soldier manning the front desk. She leaned her hands on her knees, beginning to feel like she wasn’t in full control of her body, acutely aware that she was panting far too much for a short run.
Denis was leaning his back against the glossy white wall, looking as though he was about to pass out. Amber forced her legs toward him jerkily, taking his face in her hands. 
“Hey. It’s going to be okay,” she told him, just as he sagged down the wall to the floor. 
Between labored breaths, Denis struggled to say something. Amber knelt shakily and put the side of her head close to his face. “What was that?”
“I gave my mom a bonsai solaxis for her birthday,” he whispered. His breath felt cold on her ear.
Amber’s eyes widened involuntarily as she remembered going with Denis to pick out the stylish gift. She wrapped her arms tightly around his shoulders. “Your mom’s at work, Denis. Where they have air filters, just like every residence and workplace does now. Tons of people will survive this, and our families, too.”
Thank goodness for those air filters, Amber thought. They were a new development, one of the many welcome changes made possible by the planet’s recent prosperity. For centuries, 808 had been destitute, with scarce resources to support itself or to offer anyone desperate enough to trade. But that was before the visitors from a nearby solar system landed two long nights ago — wealthy visitors with a bottomless appetite for the mineral ladus. 808 was happy to provide. 
But as the planet’s prosperity grew, so did the fear of invasion by Nin, which had a history of imperialism and a brand new reason to pay attention to its closest neighbor. Thus, the 808 Defense Force had begun training in earnest, and the armory began to fill with fantastical technologies traded from a distant planet. 
The city had collectively held its breath when the Nin delegates arrived, then relaxed as the encounter passed peacefully, a union forged, and an exquisite symbol of friendship left behind. 
Amber felt a violent bitterness, as though her veins were flooded with liquid hatred, thinking about the performance of goodwill the Nints had put on. She harnessed her anger, squeezing her comatose maybe-fiancé as tightly as her weakened arms would allow her, hoping he would understand that she was projecting every ounce of own strength into his survival.
“The medics will be here soon,” she said reassuringly, or at least she thought she did. Amber didn’t notice her grip loosening and her head slumping forward onto her chest as her consciousness faded into nothing.
A panel on the river face of the silver prism slid aside and fighter aircraft after fighter aircraft shot from the dark interior. The sleek ships, blinding in the early morning direct sunlight, banked sharply over the city and swiftly gained altitude, disappearing into the atmosphere. 
Behind the mirrored lens of her domed helmet, Amber piloted her craft through the hatch and followed the ship in front of her in an arcing, low path over the buildings. Her downdraft cut through the pink blanket covering the city, and she could just make out bodies sprawled on the sidewalks. She averted her eyes, steeled her mind, and pointed the nose of the ship upward. Within minutes, she was exiting 808’s atmosphere.
Amber had woken up in her own dorm bed feeling refreshed, thanks to the anti-toxin IV she had spent the whole wake cycle on, and learned that Denis had been taken to the hospital in critical, but stable, condition. 
But she couldn’t focus on that now. Here, speeding through space, she was fulfilling her purpose as a soldier of the 808 Defense Force, just as its General had called on them to do hours before.
"Soldiers, as you know by now, we have been the victims of a serious attack by the planet Nin,” he had told them, “The death toll is high, and rising by the moment. Exposure to the solaxis mist lasting more than about five minutes is lethal, and it can be assumed, given the positioning of the Bright Future Planetary Friendship Garden, that our Defense Center was the main target. They tried to kill our defenses and as many of our people as they could, and if it wasn’t for our filtration system, which they do not appear to have known about, it likely would have worked. This is an act of war."
Amber had sat up straight at the “w” word, which she had been taught was an absolute last resort. At first, 808 had been guaranteed to receive the worst of any confrontation. Then, it avoided conflict out of reluctance to cause the kind of irreversible, pervasive harm that the planet was now capable of inflicting. 
The General had continued, “I’m sure they figured that even should some of us survive, we wouldn’t risk our fragile numbers by launching an attack. But they didn’t know that we have a weapon, too, that puts them in far more danger than they pose to us. 
Here, he had taken a lengthy pause, seeming to understand the weight of the consequences that his decision would have on millions of people. “Our response will not be subtle, and it will not be merciful. We will do what they tried: wipe them out with minimal danger to ourselves. Nin’s major cities will be left standing, but not a single being will breathe within them. The time of kill or be killed is here. We are going to war.”
The Nints would not be expecting them, but they had to be prepared. As part of the defensive unit, Amber reached her coordinates and stopped, watching the lights of the ships ahead of her fan out to form a line thousands of miles wide. To her sides, a twin line extended in either direction. Hundreds of fighter ships waited silently for their enemy.
On the looming, emerald planet filling her window, Amber could see where the day met the night, passing over the surface hundreds of times faster than on her own planet. She saw the lights of a major city wink into existence and knew that it would be targeted, the teeming life extinguished. 
808’s offensive crafts would be flying close to Nin’s atmosphere by now, triggering its defenses, pathetically little, devastatingly late. Though she was much too distant to see the bio-specific bombs released, Amber saw the blaze as they passed through the atmosphere, burning up their outer layers.
Though it was just for an instant, nothing like the lingering sunrises from her planet, the fiery display reminded her of the golden show the sun was continuing to put on back in the Thousand Mile City. Soon, anyone who wanted to would be able to move to the newly-empty Nin and have a sunrise every time they wake. Denis would like that, she thought. Maybe they could even live close to a lake or ocean.
“808, welcome to your bright future,” Amber said, watching the destruction of a world.

I’ve always been mesmerized by sunsets. The way the different colors are painted across the sky each night has a different finish. How every day it’s different shades of blues, purples, oranges, and many more. My favorites are the oranges, How orange and red mix together overlapping one another glowing bright like the skies on fire. It’s one of the many reasons me and my mom have picnics so often. We try to be adventurous and choose different locations. Sometimes we travel hours away from Atlanta to explore new parks or hiking trails. And other times we stay close to the city and just enjoy our signature park a little south of my mom’s workplace in the city. I'm graduating this summer and have been looking into colleges. It's honestly been more frustrating than exciting because I have no clue what or who I want to be after High school. All I know is I want to make money and study somewhere in any city. A couple of months ago a college recruiter from The University Of East London emailed me about studying abroad and how easy it is. Seventh grade me would be laughing hysterically because she wanted to go to school in the U.K until she found out they barely get any sun. Although I think moving to London would benefit me now so when I received the email I immediately applied. It’s been a while and I still haven’t heard anything from the university which is starting to worry me. I have been so distracted with London and figuring out what I want to study or what my profession should be that my mom and I haven’t been able to plan any picnics. My mom has been busy with her work a lot lately and we’ve sort of drifted into our worlds. Sometimes I feel as if her work is more important than mine because all we talk about is her even though I’m the one graduating. I wanted to change that and wanted us to have a nice picnic today since the weather was nice. We live about 15 minutes out of the city so I rented one of those city bikes to head around and pick up all of our favorite snacks for the picnic. It was 6 PM and my mom normally gets off work at 7:30 which is perfect timing for the sunsets. I packed my tote bag with my money, This really good book I bought on a whim, And my sunglasses and headed out. My first stop was still a little sandwich shop on the corner on the east side of the city. The outside has a colorful welcome mat, wind chimes, and pots everywhere full of different colored plants and flowers. When you first walk in you get a strong scent of garlic and fresh basil. There are little tables scattered on the side of the shop with a variety of table clothes on each one. When I got to the counter I ordered my mom's and my favorite sandwiches, mine being the spicy toasted Italian and my mom’s being their specialty pesto grilled cheese. I went back to my bike stationed outside and looked around. There were posters and flyers everywhere about the new “Apocalypse” movie premiering this next Friday. I was planning on asking a couple of friends from my work to go see it but lately, I haven't felt like socializing with them because we're not that close of friends, and to me, I don’t feel like being the one always asking people to hang out instead of getting invited. It was now 7 PM and so far I got the sandwiches, our coffees at this signature cafe, and mini tea cakes from the bakery next door to the cafe. I find it cute how they are neighbors and compliment each other so well. I went to the park south of where my mom works and walked down the long walkway till I found a nice shaded area covered by trees. One thing I adore about this park is even though it’s in the city it still manages to hold that nature aspect when you walk into it. It’s like you can escape into this wooded sanctuary and just be at peace almost like you're leaving all your problems in the city. I needed this with all the stress of colleges and picking a career. I set up our blanket and laid out all the food and drinks. Then since I had almost twenty minutes to spare, I pulled out my book and lay there reading as time passed. I was so wrapped up in my book and the fantasy world that I hadn’t realized how much time had passed. Normally in Atlanta the sunsets around 8 PM. When I looked at my phone I was shocked to read 8:36 PM. It must be my phone glitching? I thought to myself because looking up at the sky there it was, The sun beaming high and bright. I unlocked it and went to my contacts to call my mom but when I clicked the dial it went straight to voicemail. I tried sending a text but then I noticed I had no service, Not even a bar. What should I do? I started packing everything back into my tote bag and started heading back. As I got closer and closer back to the reality of the city I could hear honking and yelling. As I exited the park I was confused to see people everywhere running and screaming. Some people were slamming on their breaks and running out of their cars just leaving them there in the middle of the roads. I could feel my heart rate pounding and my hands beginning to shake as I looked around everywhere to see nothing but chaos and overwhelming feelings of confusion and worry. What Is this? I started in the direction of my mom's work and all over people kept bumping into me and pushing one another running but from what?. A block away from her work I stopped and looked at the city clock which now read 8:55 PM. So it wasn’t just my phone. But the sun? It hasn’t set or…Moved? Before I could finish that thought or even think about it, someone bumped into me pushing me to the ground where I dropped the coffees’ all over my outfit and scraped up my hands. I got up and began running faster than I ever have in my life feeling my heart pounding like it was telling me to run faster. As I was running I tried not to look around at the havoc. All over people crashed into one another, some were breaking into stores others were stealing cars. I made it to her work and ran up all 10 flights of stairs and began pounding on the door since you needed a key card to get in. My mom’s best friend and co-worker, Rory, Opened it and as I looked at her face I could see tears in her eyes. I walked in and all of her co-workers were surrounding the office TV. Some were crying, some looked pale like they just were told we were all dying. Are we? On the TV a news reporter began,
“All across the world panic and destruction rise as it seems…excuse me...The sun is not…Moving?” As the reporter pauses to hear more information everything stops as a huge explosion erupts outside. We all rush to the window to see an explosion that is now on fire in the middle of the street. It wasn't small, it looked to be about two car lengths big. Before anyone could say anything we all saw a huge metal piece falling from the sky and once again exploding with impact to the ground. I couldn’t tell what the metal piece was. The TV began making static noise and the reporter came back glitching out every other word. 
“We have a word from NASA…Space control…satellites…it appears…gravity in space…could…be the end”. Before he finished the TV cut out. Everyone stood in silence for a moment, frozen with shock. Some began running out of the office, others began crying. My mom turned around ungluing her eyes from the TV.
“Oh, Sasha,” She says as she walks over to me wrapping her arms around me. When the warmth of her arms hit me it was like every emotion that was blocked from the shock came tumbling out and I cried into her arms. All I wanted from this day was a simple picnic to reconnect with my mom. 
“Mom…Could this really…Be the end?”.

“Write about light returning to a place that has been deprived of it for a long time”
Light Chasing
I can still remember the day the light left. I was four years old. I was in the small oak tree in my back yard, holding onto my children’s book, flipping through the pages and looking at the pictures. I was too young to read yet, but I remember loving the pictures and trying to figure out the story. Then the shadow came, swallowing the great Aonani. Her light slowly left our town, then it was black. The screams started soon after.
Today is the fifth year without Aonani’s blessing on us. I can still feel the change in the pasture when her blessing left. The dark was cold at first, but then we adapted. We sued the glowing algae to make light. We got used to the dark and the cold. We overcame the darkness. In school, they teach us about this, and what it might mean. There are many theories, and the most prominent one is that Adreanna -the god of the shadows- kidnapped Aonani. That’s the one they usually talk about. I don’t get why they teach it at school, at least to this grade. We were all there; we saw it happen. We don’t need to know more about it.
As I walk to school I think about all of this. I remember that day again and again. Watching the sliver of light disappear from up above. As I’m walking, one of the Leader’s attendants comes up to me. 
“Hello?” They seem breathless. Did they run to catch up with me? “Are you Ace?”
I’ve never even been acknowledged by the Leader, much less have had one of his attendants come up to me before, “Yes. I’m Ace.”
“You need to come with me. Now.” The attendant walks away briskly away, expecting me to do the same.
“Huh? What?” I don’t’ wan t to be left behind, so I follow.
“All your questions will be answered when we get there and your teachers have been notified,” the attendant says. They don’t even turn around. They just keep walking. 
I mumble under my breath, “Okay then…”
“What was that?”
“Nothing.”
Thanks to the attendant’s brisk pace, we arrive at the Leader’s house in no time. The attendant tells me where to go, and stays at the door. I try to remember all the directions, but end up lost anyway. Just as I’m trying to trace back my steps to the front door, a voice from behind me asks: “Are you lost?”
I whip my head around, startled, to see the Leader. “No- I mean yes. I am lost, but I’m supposed to be here. By which I mean in this house.”
“So you’re Ace, I presume?” The leader asks.
“Yep. That’s me,” I reply, thinking I need to be more formal, I add, “I’m Ace, Leader.”
“Just call me Felix,” The man says.
“Okay?” I say. 
“Come with me. To my office,” Felix directs me. He walk off, but unlike his attendant, he walks a bit slower, and looks behind him to see if I’m following.
“Sure. Why not,” I say quietly. Soon we get to the leader’s office, and he directs me to a small cushioned chair in front of a desk. Felix sits in the large chair on the other side.
“I bet you’re wondering what you’re here for,” he says.
“Yeah,” I reply.
“Well,” the leader fixes his posture and straightens some papers on his desk. “As you know, the great Aonani left us and sent us to the shadows. Every few years, we send some brave civilians to try and bring her back.”
As I listen to this, all I can think about is who they’ve sent before. I’ve never noticed anyone leaving, but I don’t pay attention that much to people outside my small friend group. “And this applies to me how?”
“As you may have guessed, I have selected you to be the newest adventurer.” As the leader says this, the tone of his voice drops, and becomes more serious.
“Why did you pick me?” I ask.
“Well, You’re a smart boy, Ace,” the Leader says, “We need people who could be inventive and creative.”
“This is a dangerous mission. You don’t have to accept this task. We could find another person.”
What can I say? The leader of the place I live in just asked me to go save the most important goddess in our culture. “I’d love to accept this mission.”
“Good. You can invite a friend to come with you, if you would like.” The leader smiles now. “You can leave whenever you want. You should go talk to your parents now.”
“Okay.” I say, starting to leave. Then I realize that I should probably say something else, leading to this awkward afterthought: “Thank you for this opportunity, Leader- er- Felix.” I walk out of the room before he could reply.
I jog all the way home, wracking my mind to figure out what to say to my dad. He’s already lost my mom, and I’d feel so bad if something happened to me and he’s left alone. Eventually I come up with a script in my head. 
“Hey dad,” I say once I walk in the door of out house.
“Hey bud, why’re you home so early. I was notified you didn’t go to school?” He gives me a mischievous grin“Were you getting into trouble again?”
“No, dad. I was called to the Leader’s house. He wanted to talk to me.” Its alright, I say to myself, follow the script.
“Oh. What for? Did you really get into trouble?”
“No. He wants me to do this special mission. He wants me to get the light back.” I try to pass this statement off as nonchalant, but I think I failed, because my dad looks at me shocked.
“What?! Are you going to do it?”
“I’m not sure yet. He told me to ask you.” I feel bad already. He looks so sad at the thought of me wanting to leave.
“Ace, this is an amazing opportunity, if you want to, you should totally take it.” He tries to make himself smile, but the tone of his voice tells a different story.
“If its okay with you, I think I will.” 
“Sure. When are you leaving?”
“I was thinking tomorrow,” I say, “Leader said I could bring a friend, so I’m going to go ask around.”
“You should bring Max. He was always such a nice kid.” My dad says. Max was my best friend in elementary school. He always got me in trouble, though. I stopped talking to him as much once we got to middle school.
“No. I was thinking I would ask Lora. She’d really smart and would probably help me more than what Max would do,” I say.
“Oooooh,” my dad says, wiggling his eyebrows, “Lora.” My dad knows that we’re just friends, but can’t help but make jokes whenever I mention her.
“Dad,” I complain, matching his playful tone.
“Okay, Okay,” he says, holding his hands up in surrender, “If you’re going to ask her, you should go now.”
“Okay dad. I‘ll be back soon.” 
My dad waves at me as I walk out the door, but I look away once I get to the end of our algae coated sidewalk. Lora’s house is just down the street, so I assume a leisurely pace. Soon enough, I arrive on her doorstep. I knock, and she comes to the door.
“Hi Ace, what do you need?” She asks, poking her head out the door.
“Can you talk for a sec? I have a question for you,” I explain.
“Yeah,” she says, coming outside.
“I was called to the Leader’s house today, and eh asked me to go on a mission for him to try and return the light.” I begin, “He said I could bring a friend to go with me, and I thought I’d ask you.”
“Wow, Ace. That’s awesome. I can ask my parents, but I’d love to,” she answers quickly.
“Remember, this mission will be dangerous, Lora. Don’t come if you’re not prepared for that,” I warn her.
“You think I’m scared? Of course not. Its been a bit boring here anyway,” she says, gesturing around to the dark world around us.
“Just making sure,” I reply.
Lora heads back to her home, presumably to ask her parents about this. After about five minutes outside, she pokes her head out the door again. She gives me a thumbs up, and I grin.
“Meet me at my house in the morning with your stuff,” I say, “We leave tomorrow.”
She gives me another thumbs up, and goes back inside once more. I walk home at a faster pace. I’m very excited to do this, but I’m also terrified. The Leader said this was a dangerous mission, what If I die? What if Lora dies because of me? I don’t’ think I could live with that. I can’t let that happen.
I get home soon enough, and me and my dad have dinner. I can barely sleep that night, I’m so nervous. I wake up early, which is weird for me. I pack. My backpack with power bars, water bottles, and other essentials. I wear a t-shirt and a light hoodie, but put a heavier coat in my backpack in case. I wear sweatpants, but pack shorts as well. The only shoes I bring are my hiking shoes.
Just a few minute after I’m done packing, Lora shows up at my door, also sporting a backpack. I hug my dad good-bye and Lora and I start off on out adventure. 
The first thing we do is try and find a way into the tunnels that will lead us up to the light. We soon find one behind the school. We both take a deep breath and start on the first leg of the journey. There are no real obstacles, unless you count that I’m wildly out of shape. Lora, on the other hand, is just chugging along, not even stopping for breaks unless I ask for one. 
I check my watch, and its soon for rest. I realize that I didn’t pack anything to sleep with, but Lora pulls out two sleeping bags, because of course she packed extra. We sleep until Lora wakes me up in the morning. Then we continue our journey.
Today is the first day we encounter our first real problem. There’s a big crack in the ground, with no way to get around it. Lora and I were contemplating just giving up and going back, when a voice speaks up from the darkness: “You need some help from that?”
Both me and Lora jump. “Who’s there?” I ask the darkness.
“Someone like you, sent here to find Aonani,” the voice says.
“Why are you stuck here?” Lora asks. 
“Just decided to give up. This is a nice place if you get to know it,” the voice says, “There’s a stream with clean water over there, and there are always bats to eat.”
“Where are you?” Lora asks again.
“On the other side, of course.” It says.
“How did you get there?” I ask.
“That bridge over there,” it says. The voice seems to have turned to one side of the crack. Both Lora and I mov over to that spot, and immediately spot what the voice is a talking about. 
It’s a small rope bridge, with two rope railings and one rope for the bottom. It isn’t the most secure thing in the world, but it’s better than falling to my death. I start to edge across the bridge, and Lora follows me. I can hear her breath about a foot behind me. As we near the end of the bridge, we start to hear the ropes squeak under our combined weight.We both rush to the solid ground on the other end. 
“Alright. We’re here. Where are you and who are you?” Lora asks, now breathless.
“My name is Dimitri, and I’m right here,” as they say this, the light shifts, and I see a woman, only a bit taller than me emerge front he shadows. At first, I think she’s slightly glowing, but then I realize she has put some of the lowing algae in her hair. Not enough for it to fully light her, but enough to see. 
“Hello there, Dimitri. I’m Lora, and this is my friend, Ace.” Then Lora explains all about how they got here and what they’ve been through. She ends with the unexpected question of if Dimitri would like to join us on the adventure. Dimitri reluctantly agrees, and we continue on.
The rest of the day was mainly just walking, Dimitri going in front, then myself, then Lora. We sleep again, then get up and continue walking. This cycle continues for Aonani knows how many days.
On what I think is the seventh day, our first tragedy happens. We had run out of ink, which we were splashing on the ground to light the way, and Lora spotted a patch of the algae. She ran ahead into unlighted ground, and fell through an unseen crack. I’d like to think that thy heard my screams all the back in the town. 
We wait in that area for another day, honoring her memory, then decide to continue on. Three more days in almost unbroken silence ends when we encounter a sheer wall. There are little to no hand or footholds, but this is obviously the way to go. We spend two days in the area where the wall is located, trying to figure out how to climb it. 
It’s Dimitri who figures out the solution. She makes two pairs of shoes with spikes made out of sharpened stone pieces on the bottoms. It takes two more days to make all of them, but finally, she finishes. We start the climb early in the morning, and when we get to the top, its evening. We can see a ledge, and above it is an oval hole in the ceiling. Above the hole is a rock. Dimitri and I sit on the ledge and use our combined strength to lift the stone covering the hole. 
As we lift it, we are both blinded my the light streaming in through the crack in the ceiling. Because of this, Dimitri falls down the wall. She shouts up that she’s okay, but she’s broken her legs.
I use what’s left of my strength to lift and move over the rock covering the hole. I climb up through that, to see if there’s anything in what’s sure to be this barren land that could help Dimitri.
Instead of a barren land, once I cope up out of the hole, I see green. Green plants coating the floor. Green things on brown trunks. I’ve never seen this before. I would never have guessed that this world above the cave would be so lush. I think I’ll stay up here.
I quickly find some sticks and throw them down for Dimitri to make a crutch with. I shout at her to find her way back and tell their stories. Tell the village that they can come to the surface too. 
Then I leave. Walking through what must be forests. Basking in the everlasting light of Aonani.
<|endoftext|>
It’s been 8 days since that freak electrical storm hit the town and left enough electrical ions in the atmosphere to keep the sun from setting. 8 days of around the clock sunshine. It sounded like a huge sonic boom coupled with a bit of a quake in the ground then nothing. Perfect stillness right in the middle of the day. Not even the birds could be heard chirping. It was kind of eerie.
Lainie remembers walking out of the post office when it happened and then only being able to see spots for the next two hours straight. It was a good thing it was her day off because the spots were so intense, she had to sit in the post office parking lot until they went away enough for her to drive home and check on her family.
Her husband was at work and the kids seemed unfazed by the strange phenomena. They were in the den playing games as usual while she was gone. The animals were definitely affected by the boom. The dogs were found cowering under the kid’s bed and it took her quite some time to get them to come out. She finally used their favorite treats to lure them into the den to be with the kids. The cats took her a bit longer to find where they were hiding. She found one in an empty box in the den, one on top of the kitchen cabinets near the ceiling, and two hiding in her closet which Lainie found intriguing because she always kept her door closed for the very reason of keeping animal hair out of her bedroom. She picked up the two in her closet and set them outside her bedroom door and went to the kitchen.
Lainie called her neighbors one by one. They all felt and told her the same thing. People were scared wondering if something catastrophic was about to happen or if they were going to wake up the next day with their skin melting off from radiation poisoning. The news didn’t offer anything more than a government agency reporting “a typical sonic boom and nothing to be concerned about. The remaining electrical ions should dissipate within the next 24 hours and everything will be back to normal.”
She remembers looking around and seeing all the clocks in her house blinking the time as if the power had gone out when the boom hit. And still the birds were quiet. Not a peep. Lainie pushed the growing apprehension in her gut aside, put on a brave face for her kids, and started making dinner. Things were never going back to normal she thought. Lainie wondered just how abnormal was it going to get?
The ions didn’t dissipate in 24 hours like the government said. Big surprise. The extra hours of sun seemed to give people a boost of energy which was kinda cool at first. Kids played outside longer as the adults hung out with friends on each other’s porches drinking beers and grilling hamburgers. It was like an extended summer and no one wanted to go to bed early.
After the first three days of 24-hour daylight; however, the effects began to show. Kids were running around acting like deranged over-stimulated little beasts alternating between moments of screaming “I hate you!” to anyone nearby and then asking the same person 5 minutes later, “You wanna play a game?” The adults weren’t much better. At least with the kids, one could understand their lack of ability to navigate their complex emotions on very little sleep and offer some sort of comfort or grace. The adults, on the other hand, just got on each other’s nerves much quicker with greater intensity. One minute, you’d be empathizing with your co-worker or neighbor about being tired and the next minute facing off with someone accusing you of stealing their lunch out of the communal fridge or berating you for leaving your garbage cans out on the street a day too long.
People tried to give each other grace but they were irritable from the lack of sleep. Their circadian sleep cycles had been disrupted and they didn’t know what to do. A local doctor theorized, somewhere along the fourth day, the extra electrical ions people absorbed while outside were actually charging their body’s energy sources which was preventing them from winding down at night for sleep. He suggested people hang blankets on their bedroom windows to block the light and spend more time indoors but it didn’t cure the sleep problem. They were still full of energy only now were lying in the darkened rooms unable to sleep. The doctor suggested melatonin supplements but even large doses wouldn’t calm anyone down enough to make a difference.
People took matters into their own hands and watched boring movies, read boring books, and exercised until they couldn’t stand anymore but none of it worked for long. They were fully recharged after just an hour of rest. Their minds couldn’t handle it. They needed the downtime and didn’t know how to get it. They began turning on each other. Verbal arguments soon became physical altercations. The police were called but they were irritable too so that didn’t help de-escalate anything. They eventually got so tired of not making any headway with people, they stopped answering calls and left people to fend for themselves. It didn’t take long for mass chaos in this small town.
Gone were the pleasantries. No more, “How are you today? Anything I can help you with?”
“I’m fine, thank you. How’s the family? I’ll take one of these pastries.”
“Oh, just fine. Thanks for asking. Here ya go. Have a nice day!”
“You too, say hello to your family for me.”
“Will do!”
Now it was, “What.”
“Gimmee that pastry there.”
“Hmph.”
Lainie’s household wasn’t much different than the rest of the people but she felt it was just too much to handle being out there in town. Her kids had come home from school a couple of days already looking like they had been beaten up. She decided to keep them home. She called into work and told her boss. He yelled some kind of profanities about no one coming to work and how he’d have to shut things down before Lainie hung up the phone. She didn’t know what she was going to do but she had to figure something out for the sake of her kids.
Her husband was especially feeling the repercussions of what was happening. He worked at the government facility who released the statement about it being a regular sonic boom and the electrical ions. Funny thing is, he didn’t seem affected physically by the ions. He slept soundly and deeply as usual and woke refreshed and ready to go for the day. He was tight lipped about what actually happened and would only say it was going to be over soon.
About 5 days ago, Lainie’s husband starting spending longer days at work and eventually stopped coming home altogether. She figured it was too hard for him to be around a bunch of irrational sleep deprived people when he felt perfectly fine. She didn’t think he was going to come back. She didn’t think this phenomenon was going to end. Lainie was angry at her husband for deserting her and the kids and for probably having something to do with this whole mess and leaving her to deal with it on her own. She knew she had to do something about it but her mind wasn’t thinking clearly and she didn’t want to do anything she would later regret or commit harm on someone.
Lainie made her kids some microwave pizza rolls, threw some cheese puffs in a bowl, and grabbed a half a dozen juice boxes. They were completely engulfed in playing their video game and barely noticed her as she set everything down on the coffee table in front of them in the den. She then grabbed a backpack from the hall closet and put in a flashlight, some dark gloves, a dark beanie, a water bottle, and a couple of protein bars. She didn’t know what she was going to do but at least she would blend in and wouldn’t go hungry or thirsty. She took a look at the family picture hanging on the wall near the front door and wondered how things went downhill so fast. It angered her to find out that she didn’t really know her husband and what he was capable of. With that in mind, she grabbed her keys from the hook next to the front door and her jacket and left the house.
The town was eerily quiet considering it was only about 7:30 at night. There were abandoned cars on the road where people had crashed into each other in fits of road rage. The tow companies refused to tow the cars after one of the truck operators got beat up trying to break up a fight between two motorists. She wore dark black sunglasses with an extra-large pair over them to make it less bright on her eyes and drove carefully through the deserted streets.
She made it to the gate of the facility and looked around. No one was tending the gatehouse which she thought was kind of weird. The gate itself was useless anyway due to being barricaded with barbed wire covered wood structures blocking the road way. Some people had gone up to the gate looking for answers and things got out of control. There was some gun fire, a couple people died, and the next day it was closed up. It was like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, no one was seen going in or coming out. Except there was no chocolate inside. Lainie realized her blood sugar was probably getting low making her think about candy so she sat in her car and ate one of the protein bars while figuring out her plan.
She still had the visitors badge in her glove compartment that she used to bring her husband his lunch when he forgot or just to visit for no reason. It had a bar code on the back which let her into certain unrestricted areas of the building. She figured the badge would still work since the facility figured most people would automatically turn back upon seeing the barricade. She wasn’t one of those people. She decided to turn her car around and park along the side of the gate in the event she needed to make a quick getaway. She put on her jacket, grabbed her backpack and the badge, and gingerly made her way around the spiky barricade.
The grounds had a weird ghost town feel to them. Weeds had already begun growing up between the cracks in the pavement of the parking lot and it looked deserted. As she approached the front door of the building, she hesitated. She tried looking through the darkened glass but couldn’t see anything. Finally, she grabbed the door and gave it a pull thinking it would be locked. It wasn’t and she almost fell backward from the momentum of pulling. Lainie corrected herself and peered inside. The lobby was dark and deserted. She entered and let the door close quietly behind her. She looked to her right and saw nothing. She looked to her left and saw nothing. She listened for any kind of noise and heard nothing. She stood there for a few minutes and no one came.
Lainie remembered there was a cafeteria to the left and conference rooms to the right. If there were people holding out in here, she would know just by seeing the condition of the cafeteria. She turned to the left and began walking quietly down the hall. As she approached the doors of the cafeteria, she could hear what sounded like a television show but without the laugh tracks, dramatic music, or commercials. She crept up closer to the doors and looked through the small window in the door.
The cafeteria hadn’t been cleaned lately. The tables had trays of plates with food still on them, cups, silverware, soda cans, and wrappers. She moved her head side to side in order to see more of the room and saw what looked like a wall of monitors with various scenes on each monitor. It was hard to see for sure what was on the screen but she thought she could make out some external areas of the town and some interiors of the businesses. There was certainly something going on here and Lainie was now convinced it wasn’t a regular sonic boom and those electrical ions were never going to go away. But why? And what did her husband have to do with it?
Just then she heard a toilet flush behind her. She spun around and looked for a place to hide. There wasn’t time to run back down the hall so she ducked into the cafeteria hoping the only person here was the one in the bathroom. She quickly glanced around, saw she was alone and sprinted toward the kitchen. She had just made it out of sight when she heard whoever it was enter the cafeteria and sit down at the table in front of the monitors. She slowly raised her head up and peeked through the small round window of the kitchen door and saw her husband was the one sitting at the table. He was unshaven, his clothes looked disheveled, and he appeared to be searching the screens frantically for something or someone.
Lainie looked around the kitchen. It was a mess. Dirty pots and pans were piled up in the sink. There were old dirty mop drag marks on the floor from the freezer door to the back of the kitchen where the loading docks were. She tip-toed to the walk-in freezer. Part of her was curious to see inside while the other part of her was screaming not to open the door. Of course, curiosity won and she carefully pried the freezer open as quietly as she could. She stopped to listen for any footsteps, didn’t hear any, and pulled the door opened enough to peer inside.
She eyes grew large when she saw the dead bodies stacked up along the far wall of the freezer. Her mouth opened to scream but no sound came out. Holding the door open, she turned her head toward the cafeteria and realized her husband is probably the one who did this. He murdered his co-workers. And he was going to murder her too if he found her here. She started to breath heavily and saw her breath in the cold freezer air. The panic began to well up inside her and she knew she had to get out of there. She closed the freezer door.
Then Lainie thought she should take a picture for evidence. As she grabbed her phone from her pocket, it slipped out of her hands and fell to the floor. Lainie froze looking toward the cafeteria. There were fewer places to hide in the kitchen and she wasn’t going into the freezer. Not with all those dead bodies. Plus, what if she gets stuck in there and freezes to death? She didn’t hear anything so she picked up the phone, opened the camera and then the freezer door, and took a couple of quick pictures. She closed the freezer and started making her way to the loading docks when she heard the door to the kitchen open behind her. She didn’t bother looking back. Lainie bolted toward the door and heard her husband call her name.
The doors to the loading docks were locked. Lainie was trapped with her murdering husband. She turned around and saw him walking toward her. She started to panic. As he got closer to her, she felt the room start to spin and became dizzy. Just as her husband reached out to her, Lainie felt her world go dark.
It would take years before the world would find out what actually happened in that small town. Mostly because the documents explaining everything were classified and the government wasn’t interested in the world knowing the details of their top-secret experiments. This particular experiment hadn’t been authorized and the rogue employee had been determined to have undergone a psychotic break unleashing the experimental electrical ions into the town’s atmosphere. The ions were meant to be used in warfare. The extra energy burning the enemy from within weakening their ability to organize and fight back.
Because the town was built to support the government facility and most of the inhabitants had either harmed themselves or one another within a two-week period, the roads to the town were blocked off, the survivors relocated to care facilities for recovery, and the town deserted.
The sun still never sets there. Those who venture past the barricades do not return with stories. They just don’t return at all.

“Project D” has been active for the last 150 years. Of course, this measurement of time references when this letter was written. Keep in mind, it could be many years before this writing is ever found. After three failed attempts at configuring a device which would keep the sun shining twenty four hours a day, 365 days a year, the science finally got it right. When I was younger, my classmates would joke stating the reason the government named the operation “Project D,” was to make sure we were all getting enough vitamin D in our lives, which I guess was partially true. The government would prefer this story over the truth: three successful revolutions on behalf of the populace can really put a damper on a government takeover. 
As opposed to the entire population falling victim to a power hungry political scheme, the “very smart” government of Tirabulta figured a smaller sample size would be easier to manipulate. If you’ve pieced two and two together, you would know two things: I was a part of this experiment, and I was none the wiser. Here’s the short history for those who are still “living in the sun”: before “Project A” was ever even thought of, many scientists came out with many studies stating that happiness was healthy. Happiness can make you a more proactive citizen, a better husband, a nicer dinner guest, a more friendly neighbor…you get the picture. I can only imagine that at his time the government ran some numbers on their “scientific calculators” and equated happiness to mean production and value i.e. more money and less questions. 
This was when the “Projects” began, and it wasn’t until “Project D” that the government finally incorporated all of their policies. While in Tirabulta there was no sadness, no frowning, no night time, no complaining, no negativity, no fighting, and the list goes on and on. Happiness was expected all day everyday, and was recorded and interpreted by “lead government officials” via high tech cameras within households, neighborhoods, private rooms, and anywhere else they could jam a recording device. 
If you’re reading this and expecting the spite and sarcasm in my tone to dwindle, you’re in luck. To the best of my ability I’ll attempt to tell you the day the time capsule was opened and my life changed completely. This was when I realized everything was crafted and manipulated to create a perfect world: a utopia of happiness. If my mission succeeded, the person reading this story will know what the word “night” refers to, and what it means to go “stargazing.” If not, I pray that the person reading this lives in “Project D,” wants to learn the truth, and is as crazy as I am. 
It was the day of my sixteenth birthday and I woke up with a smile on my face, as was custom. I remember sitting up in my bed to see a plate full of pancakes with bacon smiling faces staring at me from a breakfast-in-bed dinner tray. My mother and two sisters looked at me with beaming faces as they sang happy birthday. As they left I still remember my mother speaking in the joyful tone we were all so very used to as the three of them left my bedroom:
“The city gets to open the time capsule today too! What a birthday gift for you!”
I got up from my bed and opened my closet. Looking back at it now the bright colors enveloping every stitch of every piece of fabric I owned gives me nausea. I put on my clothes being sure to nod with approval at each camera I knew was in my room just to let the authorities know I was enjoying every moment of my life. 
I could go on and on about my house, my family members, and the city where I lived. In my house brightly lit walls and many TVs flashed with ugly brilliance and only told happy stories filled with positive resolutions. There were my two sisters who were just as happy as my mother and I. Above all else there was the sun, which was easily seen through our grand living room window. 
The sun. The remarkable, happy, bright, terrible sun. A circular conglomeration of light hanging in the bright blue sky of our perfect little town. How had I not noticed earlier? How had I not been aware of the false reality which permeated every fiber of my known truth? The damn sun. A symbol of our own happiness, just as fake as every smile which hung on the faces of every citizen in Tirabulta. But I digress. 
The morning of the day Tirabulta was to open their time capsule, I had just finished eating breakfast in my room and walked steadily down our spiral staircase. As usual the sun inserted its rays deep within our lives through the freshly cleaned window in our living room. I remember making it downstairs just in time to catch the end of the morning broadcast and the Triabulta motto: 
“I’m happy to say I’m happy today!” 
On the outside I was happy, and so were my family members. We couldn’t be anything else. We didn’t know anything else and because of that we were as happy as we knew how to be. 
“What do you think you’re going to grab from the time capsule?” my youngest sister asked, staring at me with her brilliant blue eyes.
“You weren’t supposed to tell him!” my other sister exclaimed with a big grin.
“What do you mean?” I asked, laughing. 
“Each family is getting the chance to choose something from the time capsule. What would be a better birthday gift than for you to choose your favorite item!” my mother said in that same joyful tone. 
I hardly knew what to say and for the first time on that day, my smile felt real. I didn’t know it at the time, but now given the chance to frown, I know the difference. I was truly excited at this proposition and began to imagine what could be in the time capsule from so many years ago. 
As we gathered together in the town square later that day I could see all the citizens of Tirabulta smiling, giggling, laughing, and looking generally happy. We all gathered together in front of our governor who stood behind a tall podium with a large microphone. Her skin was glowing in the spotlight of the sun and I still remember her small speech, or at least some of it:
“Today marks the 150th anniversary of when Tirabulta was first founded! I thank you all for bringing such joyful and smiling faces to such a monumental and exciting day. Remember, you are only as happy as you show on the outside! (at this point a loud and timed laugh erupted across the audience).
“As you can see, next to me, the happy construction workers of Tirabulta have dug up a time capsule which has not been opened in over a century. Inside we have gifts, trinkets, and spectacular memories from the past. There should be enough gifts to give to one per family!”
A large applause erupted once again. Many families began jumping with joy, hugging, and laughing with one another. Even my mother and two sisters shoved me towards the front of the line cheering me on as I stepped closer and closer to the time capsule next to the large podium. I remember looking back at my family, their faces contorted in a smile only years of practice could produce. Upon writing this, and now knowing what it is like to sense what sadness is, I realize that my youngest sister desperately wanted to choose from the time capsule herself. 
I still remember looking inside the metal cylindric time capsule which stored countless old antiques, toys, and mysteries of the past. I now know that all of these “trinkets,” were planted by the government 150 years ago. Why the toy robot caught my eye, I have no idea. It sat in the time capsule uncomfortably against a metallic wall, being suffocated by what looked to be a hand knit sweater. I reached for it almost immediately. Its bright orange body reflected off the inside of the time capsule and its wide eyes stared deep into mine. I remember walking back towards my family, winding the gear which was connected to its back, and watching its arms and legs move at my command. 
“It’s perfect!” my mom lied with a smile on her face as I showed her and my sisters my new prize. I can tell now they were all disappointed in my selection. Why would I grab a toy robot? I had many toys back at home. Maybe, deep down, I related to the robot. Maybe I knew what it was like to be treated as a toy, programmed to act and perform in a certain way. Maybe I knew this then, and maybe I did not. All I know is my selection made all the difference. 
This is where the story, and my life, changes. As cliche as it may sound, I would never be the same after what happened in my room hours after choosing the robot from the time capsule. 
Back at home, I began to play with the robot. I poked and prodded its exterior seeing what each of the buttons on its chest would do and how the robot would respond. I held it high in the air in front of the cameras throughout my room. The cameras responded with their blinking red lights letting me know everything was being taped. Then, the blinking stopped. I did not realize it then, but this was the first time I was not being recorded in my entire life. 
The robot’s eyes lit with the same red intensity as the formerly blinking cameras in my room. A contraption on the back of the robot opened like a drawbridge and a pair of translucent ear pieces fell to the floor. I quickly reached for them, picked them up, and began to study them. I had never seen ear pieces like this before. 
I had used ear pieces before, but only those given to us by the government of Tirabulta, where we listened to programmed music and talk shows. These from the robot were different. They were almost entirely invisible and I was lucky to have found them after they had fallen to the ground. 
I quickly placed them in my ears. That is when the cameras in my room turned back on. I waited for something to happen. Had the authorities known the recording was interrupted? I stood still for what felt like hours, but nothing happened. Finally, I heard the voice of a young person speaking to me with a child’s confidence: 
“Testing, testing,” the voice rang out. “This is Millie and I am in the process of testing out my grandpa’s new voice recording system.” 
The audio faded for a moment but my desire to learn more only grew. Moments later, the voice was back at its former quality:
“I’m here with grandpa again watching the sunset together. We can already see some stars in the sky and the moon is poking its head out already! Isn’t that right grandpa?” The sound faded once again and was replaced with white noise. 
There were many words that I didn’t understand, words with which I had no idea how to define. “Stars,” “moon,” “sunset.” At that moment, all I knew was that I craved more. After more sounds of static, the voice returned. This time, she sounded older:
“They have begun to limit our exposure to the outdoors at night time. I figured it would be best to record a diary of our daily struggles as we resist whatever it is the government is planning.” Once again, white noise. 
Within these few moments, nothing else seemed to matter on the outside. I kept a smile on my face, unsure of what I was hearing. I regret to say, I cannot write everything that the recording told me. What I can tell you is that the recordings from Millie guided me outside of Tirabulta to a willow tree where she had buried a written diary from years and years ago. I can only hope that the person reading this letter has been able to find the robot beneath the Willow Tree five hundred miles East of Tirabulta.
It was on this journey to the willow tree, with the accompaniment of Millie’s recordings, that I learned everything that was hidden from me in the world of “Project D.” I saw my first starry sky, my first crescent moon, and experienced for the first time what it meant to be cold.
I still remember the first time I learned to frown. I touched my face and felt deep lines etched into my cheeks from years of smiling. I remember the first time I cried and how this made me feel more happy and complete than I had my entire life. I remember listening to the last of Millie’s recordings, and feeling what I can only describe as love for the woman on the other side of the ear pieces. 
The diary beneath the willow tree details the resistance movement to the government’s original “Project A.” It also lists a dictionary indicating each of the words the government was attempting to ban from its citizens' vocabulary. I am leaving this letter behind in hopes that one day another brave individual will find it and join Millie and I in learning the truth. I also leave this letter behind in the hope that someone who has experienced “happiness” their entire life can finally feel “sad,” “angry,” “heart broken,” and “lost.” 
As I recruit more help to resist the government behind “Project D,” I intend to fully enjoy all the emotions of life. I plan on journeying past the willow tree to find a world truly filled with happiness. This is all I can write for now because the stars are out, the sky is black, and I wish to enjoy the night.

Above and around me looms an impossible expanse of metal- the curvature of which is riddled with metallic structures that seem to mock the topography of the Earth below. An affront to whatever mad god inspired it. The people all cried “progress!”  “prosperity!” and “preservation!” Too few of us knew what this actually meant. Wars were fought to make this monstrosity a reality. Oil was plundered from neighbors, children were ripped from their mothers’ arms. People died to create Disney Planet.
After the wars, many were left destitute. Even those of us fortunate enough to live in first-world countries like Canada or New Texas or the Republic of California. Many working class people fought from their homes, furthering the psyops campaign produced by the conglomerate so many years ago.
“Well, you see, the reanimated corpse of Walt Disney has nothing to gain by lying to us. The planet is dying, most of us accept that now but too little too late. Disney Planet is our way out. Who else has the resources to do something this massive for so many people,” says a friend of mine over drinks one evening after work.
“And did you happen to see the price tag of admission to Disney Planet?” I ask, more than a little sardonically.
“Oh sure, and nobody’s got that kind of money. But you can always work for your keep. Once you’ve paid it off, you’re free.”
“What you’re describing,” I say, tapping my fingers on the bar impatiently, “ is indentured servitude. Slavery rebranded.”
“Don’t be so dramatic, it’s not like that.”
The discourse ends there. I finish my drink and leave. For some reason, it’s always the same with these Mouseketeers. You tell them it’s a duck, they ask you for proof. You show them a literal picture of a duck, the damned definition, play a recording of a duck and it’s still never enough.
I walk down the nearly empty city streets and try not to breathe too deeply. The production of raw materials has increased the amount of smog tenfold in most places. Of course, there are obvious advantages to the construction of this new world. For one thing, we are enveloped in a  constant state of work. To hear it from my nonno, work used to be hard to come by. There was always a question of if experience would suffice in a world that vilified the uneducated. My nonno worked in trades most of his life, unable or unwilling to take on the level of debt and uncertainty a higher education would cost him. Now, education is all but discouraged. You mine or you forge or you find some way to contribute to the new world’s ends.
There are also, it must be said, some glaring disadvantages to this way of life. Children as young as eight years old are recruited to lay down their pencils and pick up a hammer or a pickaxe. I hear that in years past, the average work day was limited to eight hours a day; forty in a week. What a novelty!
I walk down Market and turn my attention to the panhandlers and fences that line the street. I pass a few bucks to a young woman, clutching her dog. Her sign reads “Got lost trying to find myself.” I know this won’t get her much of anything. I notice the track marks on her arms; the fresh blood rapidly coagulating there and think, ‘if one of us can be happy by the end of the day, I’d rather it be her.’
By the time I reach the SoMa district, I’ve forgotten all about her. That’s all anyone can expect these days: brief flashes of dopamine followed by an empty, hollow feeling. A sign hangs outside of my apartment complex with a familiar-looking mouse with the caption, “Work for a Better Tomorrow!” Rolling my eyes is the least I can do.
In my apartment, I search for something organic to eat. With the light sources provided by Disney, farming has almost entirely been eradicated. The need for fresh foods has also been solved, or so it seems. My fridge is empty but for various powders and slabs of questionable substances. I reach for the whiskey instead. I’m old enough to remember a day when food- fresh produce and meat- was plentiful. So plentiful, in fact, that we threw out billions of pounds of it every year. I remember vaguely that people were still starving then and wonder how that could ever be.
I lie in bed and wonder what I could possibly do to change the path set before me. I wonder at how many people would suffer in the wake of what has been done to this planet. Weren’t we warned that this day would come? Hadn’t we had time to prepare? To prevent? Why is it now on my head that the planet we live on is dying a premature death?
I sip my whiskey and wonder these things as a commercial for some cola or another plays. It illustrates just how cool I would be if I only bought their product.
Within an hour, I turn my screen off. I don’t even bother getting into bed. Alarms are set for four hours’ time which is just enough time for me to wake up and get ready for my next shift.
I wake, I drink my coffee, I brush my teeth, I leave. Walking down the streets, I see the same despondency from the night before but almost, inexplicably, I see it in its more natural state. The people sleeping in doorways seem to be the most wholesome thing in this nightmarish place. I see the girl I slipped those bills to, sleeping on cardboard. She has a smile on her face and her arms wrapped protectively around the puppy. Her dog kicks in its sleep and I think, ‘it must be dreaming of running.’ I can’t help but wonder if some memory locked deep within its DNA is remembering the freedom its kind once had. That we all had.
This monstrosity has hung in the sky for years now. Artificial UVB light has been set on a timer to simulate sunlight, as whole countries have been blotted out in its wake. In a few days, it will take off. Presumably with enough time for the passengers to see the Earth slowly boil.
I watch this mammoth thing hang there, a proverbial middle finger to gravity and nature. I watch it float there as if mocking the creation below. I guess it’s not such a small world after all.

If Ian concentrated just right, he could make his skin glow enough to light up the entire room. 
Lightning Bug, Sister Dolores had called him at first. Never with a smile, never fondly, but still in a way that made him feel useful. It made him feel like she was pleased he was that way, just like Captain Bennet, and that coming to the House with all the other children was what he was made to do.
Thunderfly, she began to call him when the glow wouldn’t come anymore. He’d try. But it would itch and then it would hurt and then he’d feel the heft of the captain and the sister waiting for the specialness and usefulness to come back. When it wouldn’t, and specialness and usefulness became uselessness and ordinariness, he became the annoying little bug that hung around on the walls. Just one step out of line and just one squash of Sister Dolores’ prayer-calloused fingers, and he would be gone. A burden lifted from them all indeed, she would say. But squashing him would be so frightfully messy and so frightfully ungodly and, frankly, such a frightful waste of time that the sister would just have to make do with a slap of a shoe on the back of his head. 
In a place where all the children did things, she’d tut, one lacking in ability was needed not. She and Captain Bennet would make sure Ian got the glow back. 
On the first night of it, the sister came when the small hand was on the ten. A shadow in the doorway, a wimple backlit by the hall, a pair of crow’s feet tinged green from his Michelangelo nightlight. 
Ian had already been staring at the door, concentrating on the turtle’s glow and forcing it to fizzle the fear away. He had no glow of his own now, after all. Before, back when he was home, he could let it come out each night as the sun went away and the darkness came. The monsters under the bed couldn’t reach through the gleam of his skin. Their claws couldn’t pierce it like they otherwise might – talons would get caught in solid light instead of tearing papery skin. Ian didn’t have that anymore. All he did have was a plastic turtle on the far side of the room that painted him sicky. The monsters may not have gotten him yet but they would soon, Ian was sure. He was always proven right when the sister appeared in the dark.
It lit her up just as his skin had him, illuminating her foul face and its equally foul distaste. Ian thought she was a cow. A great big, fat, ugly cow with ugly hands that grasped his shoulders as she pulled him from the bed. If he was a lightning bug, she was a gooey caterpillar that someone had stepped on. Step, splat, and her scowling face would be found in the gook on the bottom of Ian’s shoe.
“You’re needed.” She unhooked his drip from its clasp on the wall.
“And you’re a mean old bitch.” He retorted and felt the pride that came with it. That’s what his Da always called Mom, anyway. From the sharpness of it when it had shot out of his Da’s mouth, Ian knew it must’ve been bad. And that was good. Sister Dolores deserved the bad. She deserved the middle finger he flourished too.
In lieu of a shoe to wield, she cuffed his head with her palm. Ian didn’t think much of that. His Da could always hit harder.
“Language.”
Ian was sure his glare looked twice as fierce in the green.
“Bitch.”
Before he knew it, his head was stinging with another cuff and his pyjama shirt was being pulled along by the neck. Ian scrambled to grab his drip pole before it could be pulled out. 
“You’re a terror for no reason, Master Wright,” she gave a sniff, “The Lord will not thank you for it.”
“I don’t like the Lord. And I don’t like you.”
That was deserving of a smack too, painful in all the ways an under-stuffed couch was. She couldn’t be bothered to answer him this time and kept her attention latched to the drag of him down the hallway. Down the hallway, down the stairs, down another hallway, down another flight of stairs. Down, down, downdy-down-down-down, until the front of Ian’s neck was bruised from the vice of his collar and they were in a room that he’d never seen before. 
He may not have liked the Lord, in all his unhelpful glory, but he liked this room less. Captain Bennet was in it, for one. There were hardly any lights, for another. It was like the room where they’d first put in his drip when he’d arrived, Ian supposed. The one where they’d bring him every week just to take his blood away. Ian didn’t know where they took it. Ian didn’t care. What could they possibly do with it, anyway?
“Good evening, Ian,” 
The crouch the captain sunk into left him a good couple of heads too short for their faces to meet naturally. Ian’s neck was taught on both sides – scratching Sister Dolores’ claws on the back and craning down to observe Captain Bennet at the front. Much like the knees of the captain’s slacks, Ian’s skin was stretched to breaking point.
“What happened to those pyjamas I gave you?” he continued, “The Power Rangers ones?”
Captain Bennet gave all the kids new pyjamas when they arrived at the House. Russ’ had Batman, Vicky’s had Sailor Moon, Lydia’s had baseball mitts. Ian couldn’t remember the others’. They were all the kind he’d seen in the stores when he went shopping with Mom. When he’d eye her wallet from beside her too, longing for a Star Wars set instead of Da’s old t-shirt. It never garnered anything but a calm smile and a Brooklyn-dipped explanation. Ain’t got enough ones for a foot-long paperchain, hun.
“He soiled them last night.” The sister’s voice came, coated in bitterness rather than Bushwick. 
“Did not.” 
But Ian could feel his face burning and he knew alabaster was flushing pink. His denial could do nothing to erase Sister Dolores’ words, nor Captain Bennet’s flicker of annoyance.
“Is that right, Ian?” He inspected Ian’s vest and gym shorts with a graze of his eyes. Michelangelo wasn’t bright enough, Ian could’ve said. The monster whispering under his bed sounded like Da, Ian could’ve said. I was scared again, Ian could’ve said. I don’t like it here, Ian could’ve said.
“I didn’t mean to.” Ian said. 
Bent legs straightened to their normal looming height. A taught neck cricked upwards to meet the one that looked down.
“You continue to disappoint me, Ian,” Captain Bennet sighed, “First your ability stops working and now this. What are we going to do with you?”
He sounded like Da too. 
“I didn’t mean to.” Ian said. Glowing or pissing his pants, he didn’t know what his own words referred to. A fierceness was there either way, one that knocked the captain’s brow into its own ferocious furrow. 
“Put him in the room, Sister,” 
Ian’s fingers tightened on the drip pole.
“And maybe then we’ll see about that ability of yours.” 
Then and only then did Sister Dolores’ grip weaken. Great pincers of bone and nail became nothing but sausages that chilled his skin. If not for the sagging swirl of her aged fingerprints and the smell of her soap, Ian could’ve kidded himself that Mom was standing behind him. But Mom had smelt of lemons, not carbolic, and she hadn’t been alive long enough to wrinkle.
“Captain Bennet, I was under the impression that we’d be going down the medicinal route,” her warbly way of speaking convinced Ian further that it was nothing but her shadow creeping up his back, “Are you… sure that’s the best way?”
Ian didn’t know what the hell they were talking about. Ian didn’t want to know what the hell they were talking about. Ian wanted to go to bed.
“Dr. Whistler was the one to suggest it, actually,” the captain assured, “He tells me that the benefits of stress are quite large when it comes to the brain. Releases chemicals, hormones, that sort of thing.”
“But–”
His eyebrow gave a quirk. “Are you saying you disagree with Dr. Whistler, Sister? Should I inform him of this revelation? After all, honesty is second nature for someone such as yourself.”
He was doing that voice. Sarcasm, maybe, just like Da had accused Ian of whenever it suited him. Ian thought sarcasm was pointless, though. Easier to just say things outright. Sister Dolores was a cow, Captain Bennet’s hair looked like a rat, Russ was bad at soccer, the nightlight Benny had let him borrow was the ugliest thing he’d ever seen. That sort of thing. Sarcasm was pointless and Da didn’t like it and Ian never did anything he thought Da didn’t like. That’s why he agreed to come to the House in the first place.
“Of course, Captain.”
Ian often thought Sister Dolores liked the captain more than she liked the Lord. It wasn’t hard to believe when he listened to the tone of her voice, obedient like the dog Da would never let him have. Her hard grip was back again too. It pushed him to a door on the far side of the room this time, his drip wheeling miserably behind him.
“Let go,” Ian yanked himself away, “I don’t want to! Leave me alone!”
A hard grip it may have been, but not hard enough to overcome an eight-and-a-half-year-old with anger issues piling to the moon and back. Ian was away from her in seconds.
“Now, now, Ian,”
Away from her and into the new arms of Captain Bennet.
“You don’t even know what we want you to do.”
What we want you to do. They always wanted things done. With all of the children. Not a day went by when something didn’t need doing. And not a day went by when Ian didn’t have to do something he very much did not want to do at all.
“I’m not doing anything!” His legs made for the door, stunted though they were by a bruise on his knee and the clobber of drip wheels over tiles. Captain Bennet grabbed him round the waist, lifted him off the floor, unhooked his bag from the pole with a withering look. Sister Dolores had opened the door and Ian could see inside now, right inside, at the room that was nothing but black and black and more black. No lights, no windows, just the tar of darkness that Ian knew would swallow him whole.
“No!” he yelled, “No! Put me down! Bastard! Bitch! Put me down!”
Ian grappled with the arms around him. His fingers dug, his nails scratched, but the two just got closer and closer. 
“Enough, Ian,” The captain’s bellow almost deafened him. With a quick thrust, he half-heartedly threw Ian into the room. His ass hit the floor, the sharp bone hitting the sharper brick, and his drip bag bounced next to him. Captain Bennet’s hand rested on the door frame.
“You will stay here and think about your disobedience and you will not leave until your ability comes back.”
The door shut.
Ian was left in the tar.
“No!” he scrambled through the pitch black, ignoring the way it made him feel his insides were going to crawl out his mouth, “Let me out!”
But it had occurred to Ian at some point in the last century of seconds that that was the entire point. That was the entire point of him drowning in this blackness. 
“BASTARD!” he slammed his hands on the door he couldn’t see, “YOU’RE A BASTARD!” 
The tar only built. Cloying and clogging his throat with the dark. Such a dense darkness it was, Ian could almost smell it. He wanted to reach for the door handle, to tug and shout until it released some pity. But he couldn’t see the handle. He couldn’t see anything. There was nothing, just nothing. Ian was locked in the nothing, swallowing it, breathing it in, the way he’d always been so afraid of.
He backed away from the door.
“Please,”
Tears. Those were tears in his voice.
“Please,”
A sob.
“I don’t like the dark.”
Nothing and nothing upon nothing and nothing. The monsters were stirring, Ian could hear them. Rustling, chirping, crawling the walls ready to pounce. Just Ian and the nothing and the monsters and their sounds.
“Stop,”
It might’ve hurt, the way he smacked his hand over his ears. It might’ve tugged the needle out and made a sticky red puddle on the floor. He didn’t know. It was hard to know in the nothing.
Now there was something else in the nothing too – his heartbeat galloping a rhythm in his brain and in his skull and under his Supercuts trim. 
thud
thud
thud
thud
thud
thud
thu–
–nch
–unch
punch
punch
punch.
Ian was in the nothing and in his own head too. In his brain, his skull, his Supercuts trim. In that memory, The Memory, the punch-punch-punch that had stayed with him for the four years that had passed. Heartbeats morphed into the sounds of a fist in a face, over and over and over.
“Mom,”
He’d been standing in the doorway. Da in the living room, Mom on the floor, both where Ian could see them. Ian in the nothing, Mom in the punch-punch-punch.
Mom in the punch-punch-punch, Mom in the ground, Mom in the nothing.
Ian had glowed then. For the first time. Da had been mad. Da had tried to beat it out of him. That had only made him glow brighter.
“Let me out!”
A voice muffled through the door. Which one? The one in the tar or the one in Brooklyn? He could hear Da’s voice, couldn’t he? But he could hear Captain Bennet’s too, that raspy accent he had, and he could feel the palms on his ears. The tug of the needle. A warm patch on his gym shorts and a trickle down his leg.
Dumb fucking kid’s pissed himself again, Lou. He needs to grow the hell up.
And then Ian felt the itch. A tingle and a sting and the white haze pushing through his eyelashes.
Ian lowered his hands.
He opened his eyes.
This time, he wasn’t sure if the glow of his hands was enough to make the monsters go away.

Every day, Armand tended his garden. He’d go to his cellar to cultivate his mushrooms. The Panellus Stipicus were his prize, they were bioluminescent and glowed in the dark, creating a spectacular display. “My nexus to light and love,” he called them.
For years, Armand has tended his mushrooms. He had been written up in the local paper and been touted an expert on mushrooms. With these mushrooms, Armand managed to lure the world's most beautiful women to come and dine with him.
Armand was a handsome man. Tall, with a slender build with thick, dark, wavy hair. And a silky voice like Jon Hamm. He had an aristocratic nose, like a Greek statue. His dark, piercing eyes were almost black. He dressed well, even when he tended his garden.
His home was on a grand scale, an Italian villa set high in the mountains, 15 miles from the village of Amantea, Cosenza. With towering, white-washed stone walls, covered with wisteria vines and grand, arched doorways, framed by columns. Cypress trees graced each side of the drive up the mountain. He collected artwork and tapestries. Magnificent statues graced his foyer. Large urns with exotic ferns were at each end of the winding staircase. His home was indeed his castle.
In the evenings, he dined in the finest restaurants. The owners and staff were always on the lookout for him, they all hoped for his favorable reviews. He was given the best tables. With the best view of the most exquisite ladies who came to be seen. And be noticed by Armand.
On this evening, as he dined at Pernod’s, a fine French restaurant, where he was sure to sample their mushrooms; he spotted an elegant lady, seated in a circular booth against the wall facing him. She was well dressed, wearing an off the shoulder white dress with simple pearls around her neck. She was quite beautiful. Then, he noticed the young woman with her. He licked the butter from the Morel mushrooms, carefully from his lips. She was stunning. Thick, raven curls cascaded to her waist. She revealed ample cleavage in a form fitting, black dress. She wore no adornments; none were needed.
He motioned to the waiter, “Garcon, who is that lady seated in the booth?”
“Oh, that, monsieur is Mad ‘am Toussaint. She is the heir to the Toussaint diamond fortune. She is here for the season.”
“And the young woman seated with her?”   
“That is her daughter, Elise.”
“Elise… would you introduce me?”
“Oui, right away, monsieur!”
Armand watched as the waiter spoke to them and noticed Mad ‘am Toussaint looking at him, smiling. He rose from his table to greet them.
“I hope you ladies are enjoying your meal.”
“Quite so. And you?”
“Delightful. I can say that I recommend the mushrooms, I’m having the Morels.”
Elise curled her lip and rolled her eyes while her mother laughed, “Yes, I am quite aware of your reputation. I have read the articles in the paper.”
“I am flattered. The two of you must come and dine with me at my villa, just outside the village in the mountains. It’s a stunning place. I think you will both enjoy it.”
“Why, you are too kind! We would love that. I am teaching Elise to appreciate her family background and about the finer things in life. At 16, she should be more acquainted with life.”
“Yes, Elise. Your mother is very wise.”
Elise barely looked at Armand. She continued slurping down her noodles, using her fingers to wipe the butter from her breasts and licking her fingers clean.
Armand bid them good night and returned to his table, planning his evening with the Mad ‘am and Elise in his head.
The evening came for his guests. Candles were lit everywhere. Fragrant bouquets filled every room. His table was elegantly set with fine China and Waterford crystal stemware and drinking glasses. The aroma of his mushrooms, sauteed in wine, also filled the air. All of which did not cover a strange, sweet smell.
His servant, Parker, was instructed to show them into the drawing room where he awaited them with champagne and the music of Beethoven’s Für Elise playing on his treasured stereo, only vinyl would do for the classics.
Parker announced Mad ‘am Toussaint. She was alone.
Armand went to greet her and kiss her hand, “Mad ‘am, I am so pleased you could come. But where is Elise?”
“Elise went with her friends into the city to see a Demi Lovato concert. I was told this was the opportunity of a lifetime. How could I tell her ‘No’?”
“I see. It’s just the two of us, then. Come, I’ve poured us champagne.”
“So many aromas in the air, what is that sweet smell?”
“Ah, the flowers, it is the flowers. I also have my mushrooms cooking.”
He quickly went to his stereo and pulled the Beethoven, scratching the record. He grabbed a Chopin record from its sleeve and hurriedly replaced the Beethoven.
As they sat down to drink their champagne and eat hors d’oeuvres, Mad ‘am Toussaint commented about the lovely paintings and old photos of women in ornate frames that graced the tabletops and sideboard.
“Who are they? These women, all so beautiful.”
“They are women I have known. Others are portraits that I have collected. I love looking at beauty.”
“Were you married to any of them?”
He chuckled, “Well, I have come close.  I did love them all but unfortunately, circumstances were not in our favor. I want to remember them as I knew them, young and beautiful.”
Parker appeared at the doorway and announced, ‘dinner is served.’
As they sat down to dinner, Mad ‘am Toussaint was eager to continue her questions about the women. Armand reached across the table and patted her hand.
“Enough about the women. Tell me something about Elise. What does she like? Does she have a boyfriend?”
The Mad ‘am laughed out loud, “Elise is a teenaged girl. She loves all the things a girl that age loves. She loves her music, being with her friends, makeup, and pizza. Does she have a boyfriend? No. Elise has boyfriends. She collects them like shells on the beach. They can’t keep her interest long enough for me to even know their names.”
“Is she chaste?”
“Chaste? I hardly think that’s a subject to discuss with you. Our relationship is such that we don’t discuss sex but somehow, I doubt she is having sex. She doesn’t have the attention span for it.”
“A young woman such as Elise should be attending classical music concerts, eating fine foods, keeping company with a well-established, older man, not boys. I could teach her, mold her.”
“I try but she is young. Too young for older men. I was young once; I know what it’s like. Surely, you remember what it was like to be young?”
Armand dropped his napkin on the table and rose slowly, “Thank you so much for accepting my invitation to dinner. We shall have dinner again, with Elise. Now, I must retire. I must prepare for a business trip which will keep me away for a fortnight. When I return, I expect to see you both for a special evening.”
“But you didn’t give me a tour of the house, never showed me your garden, your mushrooms!”
“No one goes in there! My basement is off limits. Again, I bid you goodnight.”
“You know, garlic would add more flavor to your mushrooms.”
“I. Abhor garlic.”
He turned and left the table without seeing the Mad ‘am to the door. The evening left Mad ‘am with many unanswered questions, ‘Who is this man, Armand? I must find out more about him and why the intense interest in Elise.”
Mad ‘am Toussaint didn’t waste time in researching Armand. He had a net worth of €800 million, had lived in the house only five years and there was no trace of him from before that time. In the five years he lived in the house, six young women from the village had gone missing: open, unsolved cases. Rumors of a curse or a Nosferatu began circulating, leading her to research vampires.
She returned to the villa three days later, when she knew he would be gone. Parker answered the door and told her he would not return for two weeks.
“Oh dear, I lost an earring when I was here. Would it be alright if I came in to try to find it? It’s a family heirloom.”
“Alright then, but don’t touch anything. He knows when things are out of order. I have chores out back to tend to. Please see yourself out.”
He walked past her, and she waited until he was out of sight. She brought a mallet, a small hatchet, screwdriver, and rope in her oversized bag, in case she came across locked doors. She went straight for the photographs in the drawing room and took them out of their frame to examine them.
On the back of each photo were written names and dates, “Lucille Lucetta, 1898…”
“Dear god, how old is he? What is he?”
She wandered around the house, looking for the door that would lead her to the basement. She thought it curious that a man as handsome as Armand had no mirrors. She noticed that smell again, sickeningly sweet, like syrup that’s been in the cupboard too long. The smell led her to the door of the basement. The blackness was overwhelming, and the sweet smell became stronger along with a musty, dank smell. The only light was coming from the luminescent mushrooms.
Her flashlight revealed the extent of the space they consumed in the massive basement; the basement must have covered the entire footprint of the house. She shined the light around to see if there may be a light switch or window. She could see there was a window, high up in a wall which had been boarded shut. She moved her light downward and saw two shiny, black coffins. The lids were open. The interior of the larger one was covered in black and red satin, the smaller one, in white. In the smaller one was placed white roses and a handwritten card, ‘Für Elise.”
Her heart was pounding rapidly as she made her way around the room, there were at least a dozen more coffins, but these were plain, wooden boxes. She moved the lid with the screwdriver from her purse from one of the coffins and inside was a rotting corpse where mushrooms were growing from the body. She peered into three more and found more of the same! She noticed something carved in the stone floor at the end of each box, it was hard to decipher the writing, but she could make out a name, ‘Lucille Lucetta.”
“The man is an abomination! He’s repulsive! I must stop him!”             
She looked around and found enough empty crates to make a stairway to place against the wall with the window. In her bag, she took out the mallet and small hatchet and began hacking away at the boards on the window. At last, she could smell fresh air and gazed at a starry sky.
The day arrived when Armand returned home. Mad ‘am Toussaint and Elise were enjoying the warm, afternoon sunshine in the town square, eating lemon gelato. Everyone was out that day, the streets were filled with people.
Suddenly, an earth-shattering howl split the air! The howls grew louder and longer as the sun glowed brighter and stronger. People were running, this way and that, making signs of the cross with their hands. They were shouting, ‘Armageddon! Armageddon!’
Elise was frightened and held onto her mother. Only Mad ‘am Toussaint sat, smiling, continuing to lick her gelato.
“He shall not have you, my Elise. I know how much you hate mushrooms.”

The world has always been dark.
Twisting, menacing grey-and-black shadows make up my world. A thick blanket of ash and debris fills the sky, encasing us in a wintry tomb, in a monochromatic life. My grandma told me stories of when humans lived in the light. When the giant gas star used to shine on the world, bathing everything in a
golden light of warmth. Of hope. Light was life, she would say, and scientists said that the day the sun didn't shine would be the day humanity ended. The day we all died.
We didn't die, but I think our humanity did.
After the war, the world went up in flames. For a time, there
was only light. Blinding, burning, scorching light. Red flames, crimson and gold, made up the world. Smoke so thick you couldn't breathe without a respirator. And when there were no more respirators, there was no more breathing. People fought over respirators. We thought the war ended when the bombs fell, but it only continued in our homes.
Then came the ashes. Dust and debris kicked up by the epicenter
blocked out the sky. Turned the ethereal blue of the sky to a dull grey. Once green and leafy, plants turned brown and withered, crumpling at the softest breeze. No more crimson flames, no more black soot, no greens, blues, purples.
Only dull grey.
Panic ensued. Food shortages started. Things produced in
factories became commonplace. Once, my grandma said, people gathered around massive tables to celebrate. Savory soups, desserts so sweet they hurt your teeth. And the greens-the leafy greens were always there. Added on as a garnish, as a side. Mouthwatering feasts of foods of different colors. Now, they're all the same-crumbly grey ration bars made only to replenish one's nutrients.
Sometimes, I dream about feasts. A household full of people
laughing and chatting, but I don’t listen to them. It all fades to a dull murmur behind me. My footsteps are silent on the wood floor as I approach the kitchen. Before me lays a long table laden with food. It positively groans under the weight of homemade dishes. Things I've never seen before, things I’d doubt ever existed, if not for my grandma’s words. White fluffy potatoes, long green beans, and sweet yellow bread. A pot of thick, brown liquid. Some bowls of little round berries in a matching color sauce. And in the center, a turkey, roasted to perfection. But more importantly, I see the sunlight filtering through the window. Gentle
golden rays illuminate the table in shimmering light. Life. Peace. I raise a hand towards the ray of light, fingers cold from years of wanting. And every time, I wake up just before I can touch it. In the darkness, I wake, wondering. What would it feel like? What would it taste like? Does it make sound, roaring with life thousands of lightyears away?
They say humans should have died. They say we only had a year
life expectancy left. They said we would never see the sun again, and we would die because of it. But we're still here. I'm still here. Though she's long since passed, my grandmother's fanciful words have always stayed with me. Sometimes, I sit next to the reinforced windows of our home, flipping through yellowed pages of her handwritten cookbook. The pages threaten to crumble
beneath my fingers. Her own recipes written in slanted handwriting are fading with every pass-through I take, but I can't help it. There's some sense of hope, of nostalgia, when I look through them. A memory of a dream, a time forgotten.
My parents never saw the sun, and I doubt I will either. People debate
and theorize and cry about the world ending. None of it matters to me, surrounded by cement walls and reinforced windows, blankets around my shoulders
to ward off the cold. I pretend their words of doom and gloom mean nothing to me. But sometimes, when I sit by the window and gaze at the ash-covered sky, I dream that I can see the light. Golden. Peaceful. I dream that those thick grey clouds will part, and the sun will shine. Warmth will seep back into the
ground, melting the eternal ice and snow threatening to drown us all. Green, leafy plants will unfurl their leaves and bright blooms will face towards the
sky. I dream of a world of color and life, of food and peace. Instead, all I see is grey.
Snow blankets the ground when we emerge after sheltering from
the storm. Or maybe it's more ash from the sky-I'm not sure anymore. Nevertheless, it's cold, and we bundle in threadbare clothes and blankets to line up for
rations. Grey, crumbly rations that soothe the pang in my stomach, but never satisfy the vision of the 'feast' my grandma put in my head. Everyone else lines up around us. Faces drawn and weary. We don't look anyone in the eye-don't want to give anyone a reason to think we're better than them. I hug my grandma's cookbook close to my chest, trudging through the snow and ash back towards our cement house. Water seeps into my boots, soaking my socks. On days like today, when it's wet AND cold, I long for the sun in my grandma's stories. Sometimes, if I dream hard enough, I can feel the warmth seeping through the sky, drying my socks, gracing my skin.
Shouts and screams interrupt my daydream. Beside me, my sister grabs my arm, trembling. Her long hair is tied back, greasy since it's been well over two weeks since our last allotted washing time. It used to bother my mom, who remembers when she could wash every day, even after the world ended.
“What is that?” My sister breathes.
I frown at her, opening my mouth to remind her not to ask questions that could make us look suspicious. I never get the chance.
Behind us, someone shouts that the world is ending in flame. Even with my eyes closed, red bursts to life. Warmth seeps into my skin and I don’t dare to look around me. If I’m going to die by raging fire, then I won’t look. I won’t watch as I did when the fires consumed the town just south of us. I won’t watch my skin turn inky with soot. But that burning, scorching pain never comes. Instead, it’s like a warm embrace. Gentle. Peaceful. My heart leaps into my throat. It’s just like my grandma said. Warm and full of life. Slowly, I peel my eyes apart. Golden light splays across the ground, throwing the world into sharp relief. Instinctively, I squint. Tilting my head up, I gape at the break in ashy clouds. Like the stories from my childhood, a ray of sunlight breaks through. Gentle. Peaceful. Full of life. My eyes widen and I stare straight at the ball of fire gracing our skies. With a burst of heat, the world is suddenly illuminated with white light, the snow melting around us. I stare and I stare until I can stare no more.
Later, when the clouds recover the world, it’s darker than before. My parents say it's the same, but I can barely see the outline of my own hands. Burned forever into my eyes is the outline of the sun, a tiny ball of light. My vision never returns-but the sun does, bringing with it warmth, peace. Life. Gentle, peaceful.

“How does your ship keep up with the Sun if you never leave Earth’s atmosphere?” Cade immediately regretted his question. Within the thin line of people who stood in front of the carnival stage, faces turned and eyes cut in his direction. That he liked. The loud, angry, and in some cases elderly, adults acting like two-year-olds were about to witness Cade’s smooth intellect.
It was what was happening on stage that made Cade want to walk away. The older man on the platform lifted the tiny, multi-colored hat he held and placed it on the tip top of his mountain of gray hair. “Let me show you how.” He walked down the ramp that led from the stage, held out his elbow as an invitation for Cade to link arms, leaned forward, and gave a head nod back toward his three red tents. “Mr. Infinity at your service. Come take a trip where the Sun never sets and the day never ends.” 
With the older man frozen in his same position, Cade’s hands smoothed down his shirt over his belly in an effort to keep its hairy flesh from peeking out below. “You know about the international date line?” Cade asked. “No matter how fast we go, we’ll still cross into new days.”
The carnival barker straightened up and puckered his lips. “Ooohhh, we’ve got a smart one.”
Cade’s happy face, frumpy appearance, as well as his love for cartoons, KFC, heavy metal, and carnival rides often hid his Doctorate in Geology. But he minored in astronomy, which was his initial career goal and the reason he would stand out from the other customers, some of whom had breathed out fiery insults just a few seconds ago, only to melt into the crowds the instant the carnival worker left the stage like the whole thing was none of their business . 
Cade picked at a popcorn kernel in a bottom front tooth and eyed the banner on the platform railing. It had a caricature of the old man straddling a rocket that flew up over the clouds. A fire trail from the back of the rocket curved down to the surface of the Earth. Along the side of the rocket were the words “Mr. Infinity’s Day Trips.” When the kernel finally came loose he replied, “You’d have to go at an impossible speed, like a thousand miles an hour, to keep up with the Sun.”  
Mr. Infinity’s fingers went through his closed lips and pulled out a ticket. He dangled it and then dropped it as soon as Cade held out his cupped hand.  
“If you change your mind I’ll let you try it for free. I’m here till Monday.”
“Won’t you be busy…” Most of those who had stuck around were finishing off a food or beverage. Cade spoke over a small girl wearing fox ears who sucked down the remaining portions of her drink. “Won’t you be busy taking people on never-ending flights the whole time?” 
“Try it now and you’ll be my first ride for the day.” The older man spun around and threw up his hand in a wave as he walked away. “Anytime kid. Anytime.”
Cade, feeling a breeze against his belly button, yanked down on his shirt, slightly embarrassed at the thought that his gut might have been hanging out full throttle during his exchange with Mr. Infinity. One glance at the carnival stage background wall, filled with partially ripped up, and, in some cases, completely indistinguishable poster ads and he knew he wasn’t among society’s elite.
“Okay. I’ll be the first.”
Cade found the inside of the man’s tents even creepier than the man himself. Pictures of all sorts of interesting characters hung from the tent walls like they were his relatives. One had a man sporting a goatee and handlebar mustache with a flower on top of his head like it had grown out of his bald scalp. Another was the portrait of a woman with a wide face, pigtails, and one lone tooth in the top middle of her mouth. Mr. Infinity gabbed the entire time but Cade’s attention was on the pictures. He gave a nervous laugh at an image showing a man staring directly at the camera as he rode a horse. The long hair that circled the man’s face was styled to stick outward so that he reminded Cade of a cat. 
Through a wrinkled tent flap Cade found the next tent to have more of the same bizarre vibe. In the middle of the room stood a lifelike wax bull with sharp horns curving upward. A cluster of hay hung from its mouth. Cade also caught sight of a large bird, with wings spread, standing in one corner of the room, and a squirrel clinging to the side of the tent by the exit flap.  
Before Cade knew it, both men exited the tent into open air, surrounded by people walking in all directions. 
“What?” Cade asked. “Where’s the ship?”
Mr. Infinity pulled back the end of his sleeve to check his watch. “I always lose track of carnival time.” He held out his hand. Cade did likewise and the man shook it as quickly as he spoke. “I’m sorry young man. I’ve gotta go. Need to sell some tickets. I hope you enjoyed it.” He walked backwards, smiling at Cade and then winking before facing forward to jog to the stage ramp. 
“What about the ride?” Cade asked.
“Check your pocket. And don’t forget to tell your friends.” 
Cade dug something out of his back right pocket but it slipped out from between his fingers and his palm before he could close his hand. When he looked down the only thing on the ground was a wadded up piece of paper. As he reached for it, the wind sent it between his legs. Cade moved faster than he’d moved in a while, running after the paper, picking it up, straightening it, and holding it close to his eyes to read the small lettering. At the top of the page was an image of the carnival worker’s face. Below it read:
“In order to prevent the theft of tradecraft secrets, it is the policy of Mr. Infinity’s Day Trip Inc. to require all of its customers to agree to never disclose, in any form, to any individual, any part of their experience within Mr. Infinity’s Day Trip tents as well their experience aboard Mr. Infinity’s Day Trip aircraft. I, the undersigned, understand these conditions and agree to abide by them under penalty of law.”
Below, sitting on an actual dotted line, was Cade’s signature followed by the day’s date. 
Across from him was another show. Its poster featured a miniature monkey sitting in the palm of a woman's hand. Though the attraction was probably a fake, Cade felt like the monkey. Not just dumb. Used and abused. 
Without thinking he shouted, "That figures!” 
A man passing Cade actually gave HIM a dirty look. Mr. Infinity, who was back to selling his trips, put both his hands on the platform rail in front of him and leaned forward. “It was a free ride. Remember?”
“Let’s go one more time," Cade said.
“Then purchase a ticket.”
A young boy stopped to watch the exchange, gnawing away at some sort of candy stick with a wrapper partially split open and peeled back over his hand.
“How much?” asked Cade.
Mr. Infinity pulled up his sleeve to show a tattoo reading “$ 22,226”.
“Or,” the carnival worker said, ”you agree to do some odd jobs for me - I’m a scientist - as we whirl around the Earth. It takes two to carry out my experiments.”
“I don’t wanna work. I want you to stop advertising something that’s not even there.” He hoped that the eyes he felt from the crowds around them were paying attention to his words and not just his tone. “And how did you forge my signature and get that in my pocket?” 
Still leaning into the rail, Mr. Infinity faced down in what was either an angry, serious, or impatient stare at the ground. Despite his eyes being shaded, Cade could see he was watching the boy, who now licked what turned out to be a red sugar stick with a sharp point that he’d most likely fashioned earlier through countless licks. Something off behind Cade caught the boy’s attention. With his right hand holding the treat, he bent the index finger on his left hand and stuck it in his nose. The boy laughed and headed off toward whatever had amused him. 
“Look,” said the older man. “You obviously really want to do this… again.”
For some reason Cade felt the joy of a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth.
The carnival worker continued, "It's just that you keep coming back. This last time I let you keep your memories of entering and leaving the hangar. I just wiped out the time in the hangar and on the aircraft. I figured that would turn you off enough to send you away.”
Cade’s memory was why he stood out among his University classmates as well as his work colleagues, even the older ones. Mr. Infinity was throwing out a messy tangle of lies.
“On the other hand,” Mr. Infinity said, "on every single trip you practically beg me to let you help with my experiments. Experiments that put food in my mouth and fuel in my ship.”
“Just take me back through your tents. All three this time.”
“You have to go like a thousand miles an hour, that’s faster than the speed of sound,” Cade said.
Mr. Infinity put a hand inside the hat he held. Instead of a rabbit he pulled out a ticket. “Why not try it for free?”
“Why not?” Cade’s eyes went wide, though he had no idea why.
The older man pointed to an outside corner of the tent closest to them. “We enter through the back of this tent. It’s the hangar for my aircraft. The other two tents are just side projects. We’ll eventually exit out the front of the tent on the other end.” 
As both men left the crowds of the fair behind them, Cade asked, “How many trips have you done today?”
“The whole experience is instantaneous in relation to fair time. So I can get in quite a few rides.”
Cade chuckled. 
“This’ll be our - MY - fiftieth one this morning.” Mr. Infinity stopped in front of the tent flap. He had snuck on tinted goggles. He threw a pair to Cade who started tinkering with the strap slides.  
“Don’t bother.” Mr. Infinity leaned in close so that Cade could hear him over an oscillating whirring that was getting louder and louder. “They’re pre-fitted.”
The appearance of the clouds through the goggle’s tint was a familiar sight; not in a deja vu sort of way but in a way Cade had never experienced. His confusion erased his smile and made him queasy. A million memories paradoxically filled his head while remaining impossible to pinpoint individually. 
All of that erased when Mr. Infinity pulled back the tent flap, becoming a darkened figure against the glow of the tent’s interior.
<|endoftext|>
The heat left its mark on every little sand particle in the desert but that year was different, the Year of Maya as we call it today. The ground began to fade and grew lines until it looked like chapped lips. The little bugs with their bell-like ringing began to die out from thirst. Maya remembered finding their black carcasses burning under the unyielding sun. Because the bugs began to die out, the desert jackals became hungry and starved. Maya still shudders to this day when she remembers finding a half-eaten jackal while playing with her kite one orange-colored afternoon. She understood immediately that the poor jackals had to eat each other to survive.
Yet the biggest concern was the health of the plants. The plants couldn’t pollinate through the tiny bugs since there were so few left. Rainfall lessened and the tomatoes and carrots and apples and many other crops died out. Maya used to hold onto her stomach and whisper to it, “Please stop churning. We’ll eat at some point.”
The people of the desert became very angry. The elders used to tell stories of the former planet, the one humanity lost centuries ago. “We lost it,” they said, “due to a drought.” But they couldn’t remember what had started the drought. Now, hopeless and starved and frenzied, the people of Miraj turned to the Sun, and against it. They used to worship the Sun and bear witness to its turns, drawing from its healing warmth and building their pillars and temples pointing toward its divine dimension. Yet now they were ready to destroy their own God out of pure despair.
On that night, Maya was sound asleep and so were most villagers. From the sand-colored huts, witches and wizards wearing black and blue gathered and began whispering. Their meeting was later known as the Secret Trial of the Sun. They formed a circle deep in the desert and kindled a green fire. The green flames grew closer and closer to the Sun as the wizards and witches chanted their spells. Suddenly, a black circle grew on the Sun as their mad voices intensified. The circle began to cover the Sun and erase every sunray like an eclipse though the people of Miraj did not know what an eclipse was. It engulfed the Sun completely and left behind an eternal night.
Maya woke up that morning but the sun did not. She looked outside to find the comfort of the sun rays but they were gone. At first, she thought the curtains were obstructing the light. But then she went outside and was astonished to find out it was night. The clock said it should be the start of the day. The sundial was silent.
Weeks passed and the people slowly went mad. Many fell into an overwhelming depression. Riots broke out as the Mirajans fought for food. Dreams were slowly being replaced by nightmares as the night held onto its eternal reign.
One day, Maya’s mother gave her a hug and with tears in her eyes whispered, “Maya, you have to be strong and take care of yourself and of Inti. Lock the door and don’t leave the house. Your father and I will have to take a long trip to reach your grandparents. Hopefully, we will find food there.” Then, with bodies shivering from the pain of separation, her parents left.
Maya looked at Inti, her fluffy beige dog. “It can’t end like this, Inti.” Then her blue eyes looked toward the spot where the Sun used to hang at noon. “I mean, the Sun gave us everything we needed to survive. And still, the people were angry. They forgot what they’ve received from the Sun and blamed its sunlight for the drought. I love the Sun, Inti. We must bring it back. Aren’t you tired of sitting around and waiting for something to happen?” As they were sitting on the porch, staring at the distant fires, something became illuminated like a tiny sun within Maya’s mind. “I know! We must go and look for the Sun. Maybe… maybe it’s hiding below the horizon.”
She rushed inside and prepared the provisions: twelve sandwiches, seven apples, a couple of hefty scoops of dry dog food, and all the water that could fit within two flasks. Maya stashed them all within the big backpack and off they went. They decided to go West since Maya thought, “It’s possible that the Sun set that night and then, for some reason, it just never rose again.”
Valleys and canyons passed them by as they walked through the night. Maya and Inti were lucky. They were always one step behind the starving jackals. They would find fresh prints in the sand and could feel the frustration lingering in the air. A couple of days after they left, they ran out of water. Maya tried to spare as much as possible but the desert was relentless in its austerity.
They reached a dried canyon when, suddenly, splotches of darkness lurked on the ground. Maya and Inti raised their sight to see vultures trying to hide behind the cliffs. Inti started to run in circles, barking with despair, trying to scare off the winged raptors. Maya froze. She looked at the vultures soaring toward them. A heavy tension tightened her body.
Yet, a couple of seconds later, Maya felt a strange power surrounding her. Her intuition spoke to her and, after a short moment of deliberation, she knew what she had to do. She caught Inti with her arms and tried to calm him down, whispering, “Inti, there is no use in trying to fight the vultures. Do you see how many there are? If they want to eat us, we won’t stand a chance. Let’s walk through this corridor slowly, showing them we are not afraid.” Inti didn’t understand her so Maya showed him by walking onward, emanating dignity and confidence.
A vulture plunged off the cliffs, eyeing Maya, and still she was not afraid. It landed on her shoulder and stared with one eye into Maya’s soul. She felt that the bird was somehow talking to her. Within her mind, she could hear a voice.
“You’re not like the others,” the voice said. “The others would’ve run to save their featherless behinds.”
Maya opened her mouth. “Y-you can talk?!”
“Of course I can talk. Vultures can always talk. It’s just that no one listens. But now that the night doesn’t end and the light is gone, thoughts and dreams are much easier to be seen… and heard.”
“Thoughts and dreams? Am I dreaming?”
“You aren’t. But you are listening to the thoughts around you, to the thoughts floating through the air.” The bird blinked. “We’ve been tracking you for dozens of miles and we know your intention. You’re trying to find the Sun, are you not?”
“How do you know this?”
“Your thoughts are as transparent as mine. Listen, we are looking for the same thing. Though vultures can see pretty well in the dark, it’s so easy to mistake a rabbit for a rock or a dried-up bush. And though I enjoy seeing so many stars swaying in the night sky, I really miss eating. And so, I miss the Sun.”
“Oh poor little bird,” Maya uttered with empathy while gently rubbing its head.
After letting itself be pet the vulture continues, “Maya, there’s a river not far away. You can fill your bottles there.”
Half an hour later, Maya, Inti, and a committee of vultures crouched down to drink the refreshing water of a shallow river. The helpful vulture, Nezhy, then asked Maya, “See that cliff over there?”
“Barely.” Maya had to squint. Though she did realize that her eyes had adapted incredibly well to the perpetual darkness.
“Well, if you go there, you’ll soon find an opening, a dark hole. It’s a large cave. We don’t usually mess with caves but the bats inside are friendly and we sometimes chat. They told me of a man living inside. He’s waiting for you, Maya. I think he knows how you could find the Sun.”
“Then that’s where I’ll have to go. You have been so nice to us, Nezhy. I promise I’ll bring the Sun back for all of us.”
Inti barked into the blackness and his bark echoed lower and lower. Maya looked into his eyes while gulping heavily. “Well, since we’ve come all this way… might as well… .“
They walked through a narrow corridor when it suddenly branched off into four distinct paths. Maya sang a little counting-out rhyme – “Show the way and I will sway…” – and chose the third path. As they walked for an hour, the road forked again and again. It was as if the cave was a gigantic tree and they were traveling along its roots.
Inti stopped as his tiny ears twitched. Maya stared at him. An echoing burst of wind grew louder. Then, a brown bat with a large mouth landed next to them, hanging upside-down. “Hello, outsiders! What brings you to my cave? Have you heard about its massive size and lavish corridors?”
“We’re looking for a man living here. A vulture told us he could help me find the Sun.”
“Sun? What’s that?”
Maya laughed. Then she understood the cave-dwelling bird’s confusion. Her mouth dropped slowly like a growing stalactite as the implications sank in. “Well… the Sun is a gigantic ball of light and fire which hangs on the sk… erm, above our heads, giving us warmth and life and everything we need.”
The bat took flight in circles of fright. “You… allow yourselves to live under a gigantic ball of fire?! You outsiders are weird. Indeed, outsiders are weird.”
“Mister Bat, we are in desperate need of some help. Could you help us find this man?”
“Can you not hear him,” the bat inquired.
“Hear him?”
“Shhh! Listen.” They listened for a couple of seconds, then minutes. Silence grew and engulfed them completely. Then, out of nothingness a faint murmur made itself known. It was a chant. They began to follow it, running from corridor to corridor until the chant grew louder and with it, a golden light.
Deep inside the caverns they discovered a man sitting on a leather armchair with his toes lying on a Persian rug. Behind him a circular lamp cast a strong light.
He used his green staff to stand up. The man had a very long, white beard though he couldn’t have been older than forty. As he saw Maya, he sighed with relief.
“Finally, you showed up. I was getting a bit bored.”
“Who are you sir,” Maya demanded to know. “And how do you know about us and our journey?”
The man bowed. “My name is Aleph. I am a magician. Actually, I was there on the eve of the eternal night. I was part of the group of wizards and witches that have made the Sun disappear.”
“And why have you done such a thing?! Don’t you have any heart,” Maya asked angrily.
“I’m trying to find my heart. We… I was wrong. I actually realized that we were doing something vile the moment those green flames began to lift. I tried to stop the others but they put me to sleep. When I awoke, the sunlight had long gone. I am sorry, Maya. We were desperate and angry, terribly angry. But now I have to mend things. You, Maya, will be the one who will save us.”
“Me?” Maya felt an enormous burden push her toward the ground. “Why me? What is it that I can actually do to bring the Sun back?”
Aleph smiled. He had a deep scar running diagonally over his mouth. “Well, first of all, you are a child. Can’t you see that the old people only tried to curse this and that, to destroy and to hope for the worst the moment the drought arrived? You, on the other hand, have the power of imagination on your side. You can imagine a new future since you are not bound by rigid thinking.”
“And, second of all,” Aleph continued, “you are the only child who embarked on this journey. You accepted your fear and the dangers of the road and left your home to find the heart of our world, the Sun.”
Maya stared at Inti’s brown eyes. She then noticed that his tongue was turning arid, like the desert. Every piece of skin was. She turned to Aleph. “Alright, what do we do?”
“I will teach you how to meditate. You will learn to navigate the world of imagination and find the moon.”
“Moon?”
“Yes. You see, a moon is a large rock that orbits around planets. Our planet didn’t have one… well, it didn’t have one until our curse made one appear in front of the Sun. You have to tell the moon to step aside and let the Sun shine.”
And so Aleph taught Maya how to sit in lotus position and imagine herself entering a portal and entering the world of imagination. The first time she meditated, Maya opened her mind’s eye to see a gigantic Inti. He was rolling around in a field made of pink wool. He came and licked her with his enormous tongue. She felt bliss.
Then she opened her eyes to remember that she was still inside the cave, sitting next to Aleph and Inti and Mister Bat.
“Now you have to learn to fly, Maya,” Aleph told her. Within her mind, she saw herself standing next to a cliff. Aleph appeared as a golden vulture. “Just believe that you can fly and jump. You will begin floating before you know it.” He jumped off the cliff and began soaring.
Maya jumped as well but she couldn’t lift her body. She tried flapping her arms desperately. Then she fell into a dark pit and kept falling. The longer she fell, the more discouraged she became. “Maybe I’ll never find the Sun,” she told herself. “Maybe it’s all lost.”
She woke up from the meditation crying. She ran into the darkness of the caverns and was gone. Inti followed her, barking with concern. Aleph started to shout, “Maya! Maya! Come back, you’re doing a great job!”
Maya was hiding in a fetal position in a narrow opening in the rock. The tears kept falling and she felt as if the Sun within her chest was also turning dark. Inti came as quickly as he could and licked her tears vigorously.
Maya froze. She remembered the way Inti used to lick her cheeks when she was a baby. She remembered her mother’s embrace and her father’s voice. A small sliver of hope grew like saplings in the soil of her mind. Within herself, she felt an orange sliver of light shining the way the Sun shines its first morning light into the world.
Aleph was pacing to and fro when Maya arrived. “I want to try again.” He smiled and hugged her before whispering, “If desperate people are able to create a moon out of nothing, then you can fly, my dear Maya.”
This time, Maya made sure to concentrate and to dispel any fear. Within her mind, she stood at the edge of the cliff and looked at Aleph, the golden vulture. “If I repeat an idea long enough, it becomes true, right?”
“Right.”
She closed her eyes and began telling herself over and over again: “I can fly, I can fly, I can fly… .” The fact that it did not happen right away didn’t stop her from repeating the words again and again. And after one thousand and one utterances, her feet began to float. She began to rise like the Sun. “Look, Inti! I can fly!”
Floating like the wind, the powers of her imagination took her into space. She passed through the petals of lilac flowers the size of planets, through nebulas made of gold and turquoise spots. Finally, she reached the Moon.
It was a great silver sphere with an ethereal face of a woman. She landed on her surface and found a crater. Inside the crater, one of the many ears of the Moon, Maya whispered, “Please, Moon, could you step aside so we can see the Sun once more? We miss it dearly.”
“But I want to be seen too,” cried the Moon. “Why should the Sun be the only one in the sky?”
Maya didn’t have an answer so she sat on the gray surface and glanced at the slimy lunar monsters creeping about. She noticed the way in which the monsters gave each other space to move. ‘Polite little monsters,’ she thought.
Then an idea struck her and the Sun inside her heart grew strong. “Oh, Miss Moon! I know what you can do! Why don’t you let the Sun have the sky for the entire day as you hide somewhere in the corner. Then, at night, you’ll shine as the brightest sphere out there, brighter than any star. Wouldn’t you like that?”
The Moon began to glow from excitement and joy. “What a beautiful idea, young child! Alright, if the Sun is so important to you, I’ll let him honor you with his presence.”
Maya woke up with a smile on her face. When she saw her eyes open, Aleph felt as if he was reborn. Inti was ecstatic to find his most beloved creature petting him once again.
As they came closer to the surface, they said goodbye to Mister Bat. “I hope you find your light again, you crazy outsiders,” the bat said before flying away.
Maya stared at the blinding light just beyond the gate. She took a deep breath and then she jumped like a golden vulture into the sunlight. There was joy in the air. Every cell in Maya’s body felt reawakened by the heat, just as every sand particle glowed like a tiny Sun.

Dear Diary,
No. That sounds ridiculous. I sound like I’m in middle school or something. How about I call you Di?
Why did I pose that as a question? As if you could even respond? Maybe I am crazy.
Di-
Hello, it’s me. As always. Sometimes. Maybe. Well this is off to a great start. Forget it. It’s not like anyone but me will see this and judge me. Future me will just judge past me as if future me has a leg to stand on because past me is still a part of future me and not a separate entity.
Ugh. This is getting confusing. (Also: that rhymed!)
Anyways, today I learned that we have approximately four hours left to live. Technically live. If you count living as breathing and moving about. You see we (my family and I) are about to be put into cryogenic sleep for a long time. Our bodies will be stored in pods and carried upon a ship where we will be taken to the next great colony of human civilization. I’m sitting here writing this on the front blank page in my favorite book because I don’t actually have a notebook. But I figured in case something goes horribly wrong (and future me doesn’t get to re-read this) then at least someone may find my book and the nervous last ramblings of me.
I guess I really should have said “to whom it may concern” like a last will and testament or something.
I don’t want to think about it. So let me write down what I hope.
I hope the new colony is beautiful. I hope we don’t have to wear sustaining suits to be outside the complex. I hope there are plants that we can eat and wildlife that I can keep as pets. I hope to see my family again. I hope mother will nag me about my room or studies and I hope father will watch on in silence. I hope my sister tries to come into my room so many times that my door handle breaks. I hope things stay the same, but I hope things are different at the same time.
Weird isn’t it? That I wish for both something old and something new. I hope we don’t change, but I hope for a new environment. Won’t a new environment force us to change? Things will be different no matter what.
They say that we won’t age much in the cryogenic sleep. That we’ll fall asleep and then wake up as if nothing has changed. But everything will have changed really. New stars, new moons, new sun, new planet, new year, new century even. But our bodies won’t have changed. Our personalities will be the same. At least I hope.
I’ll save the last blank page for when we get there.
Di-
Wow it’s been a long time since not only I wrote this, but since I woke up. Waking from cryogenic sleep takes a few months. Not to mention the physical therapy to regain muscle movement. Honestly, after waking, settling into the new accommodations and creating a new normal took forever. By the time we had unpacked, I had forgotten I had even written in this book. I guess I should write the conclusion now.
It was difficult coming out of the cryogenic sleep. Not only was it a struggle for all of us, but when we were conscious, they told us my sister was having a hard time. She didn’t wake when expected and her body didn’t adjust back to normal correctly. She was still hospitalized even after we all finished physical therapy. Eventually she got better, but she can’t play sports like she used to and that caused a long depression to follow. I was worried for a while. Instead of her bothering me, it was me bothering her. eventually, she found joy in analysis of games, plays and players. She works with the coaches and individual players of her teams to help them improve. I think she might continue to do so even after university.
I continued to live with my parents for a while, but got married eventually. To one of my sister’s nurses actually. The new environment had me scared for a while. And with my sister struggling to adjust and our dynamic changed, I didn’t want to leave the small piece of familiarity I had. I didn’t actually want to date at all. But he made me feel better about the new place and my sisters small improvements. It helped that he had been at the colony for a few years already. He gave me the confidence and bravery to explore the new world.
My parents are the same. My mother took to the new environment as if nothing had changed at all. She kept saying that my sister would be fine after she was released. I think she wanted everything to be normal with us so she could feel normal as well. I’m not sure it was the most healthy way of dealing with the changes. Dad is still silent, but he holds onto us more often now. A hand at my shoulder with a light squeeze, as if reminding us and himself that this is reality now.
Some of my hopes became reality. We don’t need to wear the sustaining suits anymore! Scientists final finished a dome like shield that keeps the dangerous stuff out. We’ve bred the native plants to do well in a less poisonous environment so we still have the native plants inside the dome too. Also: I have a pet! A small lizard-like creature that is native to the colony land that is now my pet. It stares at me a lot and kinda freaks me out. But he’s a good listener. His name is Fred. He doesn’t move much. Kinda like a lizard turtle really. But hey, it’s a pet right?
Things did change, but I guess I didn’t realize that time changes us as much as anything else. My sister has been well for about a year now and though she is more subdued now, she still annoys me. I got married and my parents might be grandparents soon. Change seems to come for us all.
I’m running out of page space so I’ll just say this. To whoever is reading this: change happens to everything and everyone. Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes it gets better. But it is unavoidable. And though scary, be brave and know that only you can choose how the changes redefine you and your relationships.
<|endoftext|>
The sun hasn’t shown in one-hundred years. The light was long ago blocked out by human over-consumption and pollution. As a child my mother would tell me stories of a foreign heat that would radiate from the sky. I would imagine myself standing on a hill looking out over a vast land, lit up by the light as far as I could see. Little fur covered animals would dart back and forth across the hill. A flower covered tree with a swing fashioned to a low hanging branch would sway in the breeze. I would imagine my mother’s description of warmth tickling my skin as I snuggled into my blankets. She would kiss me on the head and whisper, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight” every night before I drifted off to dream of her fairytale world.
I’ve never seen land before, other than in the few illustrations hung in the Light and Land archives hall. Maybe my mother added fantastical elements to her stories for my benefit. I don’t see how a ball of gas makes colors in the sky, how water droplets form floating white pillars in the sky, or how the light would make food grow. We’ve had food for a hundred years without the light. My mother’s stories of beasts great and small, naked and furred are another topic I’m sure she concocted for my amusement. I would often wonder if the land would also change colors with the light’s mood. Does the light hurt the way fire does? I had an active imagination and unending questions as a child.
But I am grown now. No one has seen the light in years. I don’t have the energy to mull up questions and childish fantasies anymore. I push those thoughts and memories aside as I shuffle down the narrow, dank corridor to my duty station. Another eighteen hours of laundering duty uniforms. This shift, I’m assigned to scrubbing a pungent, black ichor from week old trousers. The smell of the ichor elicits a gag as the chemical burns my eyes and nose. I repress my repulsion as I plunge my hands into the slimy muck. I won’t be getting this smell off of my skin or curls for a week, I sigh. And I won’t have time to scrub the ichor off my skin, change my clothes and douse myself in scented oils before the Counsel’s special announcement meeting after my shift has ended. I guess I’ll, once again, be lingering on the wall with the rest of the lower stationed workers. At least then my odor will meld into theirs until the source is unrecognizable. 
I wiped the sweat from my forehead with the back of my arm, smudging ichor down the side of my face as I made my way toward the corridor. Tahir was leaning casually against the wall waiting for me. The exhaustion of eighteen hours of work melted away as I took in Tahir’s tall, lean muscled body. His swooping black hair that clung to the edges of his perfectly squared jaw accented the one-sided grin he gave me as I approached him. “You look like you took a roll in the sewer” Tahir joked as he smudged the ichor down my face before brushing stray strands of loose curls from my face. “And smell like it too” he laughed. “And you, as usual, are a prick, Tahir” I countered before placing a kiss on those full lips.
Tahir and I took our places quietly on the wall at the back. No one acknowledged our presence, to my satisfaction, or seemed to notice the stench above all the other marrying smells. As per usual, the meeting drug on and on for what seemed like unending hours. I couldn’t decipher anything The Council were announcing from the distraction of Tahir’s arm brushing against mine. Only the occasional few words would register, “Not safe”, “still toxic”, “further food rationing” and the occasional hacking cough of another citizen.
The Council finally wrapped up the meeting, exiting through back doors in a sea of billowing blue robes before the citizens departed. Tahir took my hand in his. The scratch of calluses from years of laboring in the iron mill tickled my palms. He looked at me sidelong before we dashed down an empty corridor towards the large air vent in the wall. Our make-shift jig was still safely tucked behind a loose brick in the wall. Tahir and I have been exploring the shafts and taverns beyond the compound vents for years. We found our secret place when we were children. The tick of dripping water lured us to the warm pool of water dripping down the side of stone in an underground cavern. “The cavern must be fed by fresh air from the compound and closed off from the toxic air outside,” Tahir had concluded.
As children it was our secret, safe haven and play house. We would spend hours swimming, laughing, splashing and dreaming of a world beyond our own. Now it served a different purpose, reserved for secret lovers and stolen kisses. A small chamber all our own, away from prying eyes where he and I could forget our worries and get lost in each other’s bodies.
Tahir scooped water into a bucket for me to clean myself without sullying the pool. I scraped soap and a soapstone across my arms, peeling the ichor from my skin layer by layer. Small rudimentary candles lit and lining the rocks around the pool cast a yellow glow around Tahir’s chiseled torso and accenting small burn marks scattered across his body. He lounged on a rock patiently waiting for me. Chuckling when I would get frustrated with the ichor refusing to peel from my skin. Tahir padded silently over to me, taking the soap and stone in his hand he turned me around “let me help you” he whispered against my neck. Small goose bumps travelled down my arms as his hot breath caressed my skin. “Washing is so much more fun when you’re not doing it alone”.
Hours went by lost in each other’s embrace. The warm water licking away the sweat from our entanglement. Weariness was starting to resurface from the ever-increasing duty hours. The weight of Tahir pressed my back firmly against the cool stone sending a shocking contrast swirling down my spine. It was a nice contrast to the heat still throbbing between my legs. Wrapped in his arms I almost forgot about my hopelessness and exhaustion.
Resting my head against the chilled stone, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Tahir laced sweet kisses down my throat saying barely above a whisper, “Why so quiet today?” I couldn’t put my feelings into words. I was just simply empty. I had been hollowed for a long time, since my mother passed and probably before then, too. But today felt different. I had given up hope that the Council would have better news of the outside and had come to expect increasing rations. But even expecting it, it just hit differently this time.
Opening my eyes, I let my jaw go lax, hoping the feelings would turn to words and float out on a breath. I stared blankly at the stone ceiling of our safe place. A small light flicked on and off. I must be exhausted if I’m seeing things now too. But the light flicked again. I blinked back the exhaustion and squinted to look again. It was still there. A small hair-line crack the size of a finger nail glinted like a candle.
“Do you see that?” I said as I shoved away Tahir’s kisses. “I see you. What else could I want to see?” He said reaching for me again. I pushed his hand away, annoyed at his one-track mind. “No, Tahir, I’m telling you I just saw something on the ceiling. Like a flashing little light on the ceiling. It’s never been there before.” “This again, Creada? There is nothing there. There is no more light. I know you want it to be there and if it were then in a way your mother would still be with you through her fantasies. But it was just a story and riddle of a dreamer.” He replied. “How dare you,” I yelped shoving him away more forcibly now. “It’s not some story of a raving lunatic.”
Stalking from the pool I snatched up my clothes and strode towards the narrow exit. The ground slammed into my face. Looking around in confusion I saw the brown rope sticking out of the ground. “What is this?” I said. Tahir approached, stifling a laugh. He bent down and ran a callused hand over the protrusion. “Hmm, that is weird. I’ve never seen anything like it. It almost looks like the depictions of a plant root from the old world. But it can’t be. Creada, don’t go there right now. I’m sure there is a perfectly sensible explanation.” “You’re right, Tahir, there is a perfectly sensible explanation and I’m going to find exactly what that is.”
We walked back to our quarters in silence. The only sound my mother’s words replaying in my mind on repeat, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.” Tomorrow I would find the answers. Tomorrow I would show Tahir that my mother wasn’t raving. He would see. There were still unexplored vents to explore. If we could find the pool then maybe those shafts could lead to more answers.
The morning alarms came quickly. I jumped from my cot and slipped into my ratty trousers. Tahir was already waiting for me in the corridor. “I already checked both of us out of duty today.” I told him. “Tahir ran his hands over his face. “Is this about the exhaustion hallucination from last night? Please tell me this isn’t about that?” He pleaded. “That’s exactly what this is about. But if it helps then think of it as reliving our childhood years because today, we are going through the air shafts we haven’t explored yet. You can just think of it as an adventure” I told him.
We made our way to a smaller shaft at the end of an unused corridor. After prying the cover off we crawled through the small opening. “Well, at least I get a nice view.” Tahir chuckled. This shaft wasn’t like the other shafts. This one was smaller and angled steeply upward. Bracing my hands on the sides of the cold vent we started our ascent. The shaft seemed to go on forever. Finally, it stopped. I looked around for any crossing shafts or intake fans from the air room. Nothing. Just a steep drop into nothing.
Sighing, I braced myself for my potential death as I let go and plunged towards the ground. To my surprise and gratitude, the fall wasn’t more than eight feet. Tahir was still in the shaft calling out to me, “Creada? Oh my God. Creada! Please answer me. Are you alright?” “I’m alright.” I called back. “It’s a short drop. Just jump down here.”
Tahir landed with a soft thud next to me. “Is it just me or does this space feel like it’s more open?” Tahir whispered. “Let me find my light.” I said as I fished my pop-up lantern out of my back pocket. The room was bigger. Much bigger. My arms couldn’t touch both walls outstretched. There was no space this big in all the compound aside from the Councils meeting hall. At the end of the room ahead we spotted a small wooden door. “Now, that’s strange.” Tahir said to no one in particular. “Who would put a random room and door in the middle of nowhere?”
“That’s exactly the kind of thing I plan to find out.” I said as I headed for the small door. With a forcible shove we had the door open. Beyond the misplaced door was an even larger room and metal cubes lining the far wall. Something moved in the dark beyond my small light. Voices carried through the room. They were getting closer and louder. I grabbed Tahir’s shirt and lunged behind a support pillar. “Light, Creada! Put the light out!” pleaded Tahir.
We sat in the darkness of the room barely breathing as the voices drew closer. “We have to do something; they’re getting too frail. Soon there won’t be enough food for everyone” a familiar voice said. Keres. I would recognize that voice anywhere. She was our head Council. Well at least its good to know they’re concerned about the rations. Food was getting scarce. My bony ribs were proof of that. Keres continued, “and who will replace them without notice? We can’t let this get out, there would be a rebellion. And most importantly we cannot let the past repeat itself. It must be protected”
My head was beginning to spin. My body felt like it was removed from my soul. Who are they talking about replacing? We sat in the dark long after the foot steps retreated and disappeared. “Tahir, we have to move on. There is something more happening here.” Tahir only nodded in agreement as I relit our light.
The small metal cubes sat at the far end of the room. As we approached, I realized they were not cubes, but cages. Half starved men sat, cramped in the cages. I couldn’t believe what my mind was telling me my eyes were seeing. The men’s gazes only followed us. No one spoke a word. I stopped before the smallest of cages. Bile was building in my throat. I swallowed my disgust and placed a hand on the bars. “Who are you? What is this place?” I asked. The man didn’t answer. He just opened his mouth revealing rotting teeth and Oh god, his tongue was missing. A mute. “Crap.” Tahir gasped. “We won’t be getting answers from any of them.
The man pointed toward another door before him. The same direction Keres and her associate travelled. I couldn’t go through there. Keres and my sure death could be awaiting me on the other side. The man kept pointing and moaning louder and louder now. “Shh.” I warned him. “You’ll get us found.” The man only rattled his chains in response.
Tahir was still standing behind me, face ashen. “Tahir, we can’t leave these men here.” I cried. “We have to find a way to free them” Hot tears were blurring my vision now and dropping in big puddles on the ground. Tahir slowly looked down at me. Reality slammed back into his vacant eyes. “No Creada, we need to go through that door. There is something he needs in there. Maybe it’s the answer to our questions.” Tahir replied.
Dusting the dirt from my shaking knees I stood and Tahir took my hand. “One look.” I told him. We pushed through the large doors. I held my breath as the aged wood creaked in protest. The hinges squealed as the door came to a stop. But there was nothing there. No answers awaited us behind this door. Only a small hatch lay before us.
One more door I thought. We had come this far; we couldn’t turn back now. I unlatched the small door and held my breath. I pushed the small door open. But a white light poured into the cavern. I was blind. This was it. My end. White light blasted over and through me. Wet heat rushed over my skin. A moisture pooled on my skin. I cried out and covered my face with my arm. I wasn’t dead yet. At least I didn’t feel dead. Slowly I cracked open my eyes. Confusion replaced fear. White, warm light stretched as far as I could see. Green swayed back and forth at my feet. Trees dotted the expanse covered in an array of greens and little flowers. My mother’s words echoed in my mind, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.”
My hand slowly crept over my mouth. My mother’s stories were right. The light did exist. They hid it away from us. I could be free. The light called to me, drawing me out of the cavern. The green on the ground tickled the soles of my feet and up my legs. Free. The light was real. It’s all real. I looked at Tahir and he looked at me. Apology unspoken in his eyes. A smile crept across my face. Tahir’s mouth was moving. What was he saying? “Run!” Tahir’s words echoed in my ears. Then I heard it. The shouting voices behind us. “Run Creada!” He screamed again as he wrapped his hand in mine. The door slammed behind us. And we ran. Into the light. Into freedom. We ran as the suns heat tingled across our skin. Real. Free. “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.” My mother’s words guided me. Free. And I would come back for them. The shadows could not hide the light anymore.

"I remember the first day," he said without taking his eyes off the substance. "I asked you What is your plan. KillingHitler?” Paul smiled.
"Your reaction was more fun when we answered YES," Charlie replied with a smile.
"But to be honest," Paul looked at Mary ˝I think that would be better if we go back to learn something about history, instead of changing it”
"We can stay there for only 5 minutes," replied Charlie.˝We have a chance to change history in such a short time, why not make it man?!˝
"Because the consequences will be severe." Among the three friends, Paul always took the negative aspects of the issue first.
“Man, we are almost at the end of the plan˝ Charlie injected the dark blue substance into his vein and put the empty bottle on the table.
“How can you ignore the Philadelphia experiment˝ Paul said
˝Paul, come on, are we really start all over again?“ Mary murmured. 
˝Paul, We all decided to take the risk˝ Charlie supported Mary.
"That's not the point," Paul murmured. 
˝Paul is too late to change something˝ Mary approached the computer next to the device. She took a deep breath and pressed the enter key. 
In front of the mirror, Charlie adjusted the collars of his shirts by looking at the pictures of the waiters in the German restaurants of 1941-1945. "I think it ready˝
"İt's the same." She filtered Charlie from head to toe and raised her thumbs in the air. Then she opened her hands and said, "You’re ready to serve Hitler“
Charlie was looking at Mary's hands. As usual, he narrowed his small eyes and clenched his jaw. Slowly he approached her and touched her dark brown hair. "You're nervous," he said.
The light on her face suddenly disappeared. "I think we should not ignore what Paul said, but ..."
˝Mary˝ Charlie spoke patiently as usual. He wiped Mary's tears with his thumb and kissed her softly on the lips. ˝Everything will be fine. I promise˝
˝So˝ Paul emphasized ˝How does it feel to be a hero that no one will ever remember?˝
He checked the gun for the last time and fastened it to the rear belt. “One of us must put our hand under the stone”
"The molecules will be active for 4 minutes and 37 seconds when you go there," Mary said, giving him a small round iron device with a button. “When you come back, inject this cord straight into your veins and push the button˝
˝Location specified. 1939. You are going to Munich. The name of the restaurant is Bürgerbräukeller“ Paul connected the computer to the device.
Charlie tried to hide his tension with a smile. He suddenly felt a great pain in his body. He felt an electric current in his veins. All around turned white light. And .... ˝
There was a mix of almost all colors around him while hitting on the walls in the darkness. A strong wind was blowing on his face. It was as if he had jumped from a height of thousands of meters without a parachute. Suddenly all the colors disappeared. A large circle opened. He sighed as he slammed to the ground. He tried to soothe his pain, saying, "My arm!!!” Then he opened his eyes. There was a sharp smell of chlorine in his nose. Then he looked to the right and then to the left. He could not blink. The floor and walls were paved with small white tiles, grayish-white, and small rectangular. It was old, but somehow very new. Charlie stood up. He was greeted by the reflection in the first mirror. Suddenly, a man came out of the gray door behind him, and Charlie lost his temper and turned around. The man in the soldier's uniform looked at him for a second and got out. Charlie looked in the mirror. His cheeks were flushed as if he had been drunk. 
“We made it", with a stupid smile on his face. 
Immediately after crossing the narrow corridor, Charlie stopped and looked around as if cold water had been splashed on his face. There were innumerable large brown tables in the hall. Small chandeliers on the ceiling hung in a row. Large red posters with Nazi symbols hung on the upper walls. In the middle of the restaurant, large Nazi flags hung in front of each other.
It was almost impossible to hear the sound of jazz music from the noise of people in military uniforms sitting at the table. 
Suddenly there was silence. Everyone stood up. All the waiters stood in the corner of the table, holding their small golden trays. Charlie quickly went to one of the tables and stood like them. Then he saw him in the distance. Hitler looked thinner and smaller than he looked in the pictures. 
He was still in shock, a small gold tray trembling in the middle of his palm.
After Hitler sat down, everyone sat down. The sound of jazz music slowly began to be heard again. When Charlie approached the ear of the man sitting next to Hitler and said something, he listened to him carefully and shook his head. Charlie looked at his watch. 1 minute 47 seconds left. He had to do what he had to do now. If he did not return in time, he would spend the rest of his life in Germany in 1939. Heinrich Himmler looked around. Then, when he came face to face with Charlie, he had difficulty holding the tray. He could feel his heart beating in his brain. Himmler called him. As Charlie approached him, Himmler said something in German. Charlie shook his head, but he did not understand anything. After Himmler had finished, Charlie stood up and looked at Hitler.
Now or Never
Then he slowly walked around the table and peered at Hitler with the tip of his eye. 
He then pulled out a gun and drilled a hole in Hitler's head. Charlie did not know that he would be so fast. For a second, the surroundings became blurred, and everyone's movement became heavier. Hitler's head slammed into a white plate on the table. Screams and gunshots were heard around. Charlie threw himself on the sidewalk. Then he took out a small round device from his pocket. Hearing the sounds of running and screaming, he got up again and entered the middle cabin in the toilet. Then he took the device out of the hole and tried to find the vein by squeezing his hand before inserting the needle. The toilet door slammed. The needle slipped out of his hand. They were already inside. Then, when he took out the needle and tried again, he finally found his vein. Three bullets hit the right cabin. Then the door slammed. Charlie pressed the red button. The German military pointed the weapon at him and yelled something in german. Then suddenly the image began to disappear. Charlie looked at his hands. Again the same strange colors. German officer stepped back in fear. Suddenly, everything turned black and white.
This time Charlie hit the ground on his right side. "Mary! You could have thought of that” he muttered. He looked at the white walls around him. There was nothing in the room but large windows.
He hurried down the stairs and opened the door, he smelled cool, freshly cut grass. Charlie was in the city where he was born and raised, but something made him feel very different. It was possible to breathe deeper and more comfortably than ever. As he walked slowly along the sidewalk, there was a smile on the faces of the people who came face to face with him. Charlie saw different types of model cars on the road. He quickly approached and picked up one of the hanging newspapers. "Thank God," he murmured ˝I'm back on time," he said, looking at the headlines on the front page
March 12, 2022
TODAY IS 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORLD WITH ONLY CLEAN ENERGY
THE LAST STAGES IN THE FORMATION OF A SINGLE WORLD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED.
Charlie got into one of the roadside taxis. 
"We have never had an employee named Mary Atkinson," the receptionist said in the laboratory. 
Charlie's grandmother opened the door. He hugged her and immediately "You look different," was her grandmother's first words. "The clothes..." she asked carefully. "seems cool”
After an artificial smile, Charlie asked his grandmother, "Where is the Mary?"
˝Did she comes back from Ukraine? ˝
“Ukraine?“
“Yeah. I think you know that?”
"Why did she go here?" Charlie asked, ignoring his grandmother's suspicions.
"For Chernobyl," she continued to look at his grandson, with interest. "At the nuclear power plant."
Charlie came forward from the table ˝The accident did not happen?˝
˝What accident?˝ grandmother jumped up.
Then, looking at the teacup, he whispered, "Butterfly effect."
"Charlie, what is happening?" 
"I have to go to Ukraine urgently." Charlie stood up.
Charlie was very excited when he entered the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. It was one of the most beautiful places Charlie had ever seen.
˝Charlie!!˝ Mary shook hands from a distance, quickly approached Charlie, and hugged him. 
Charlie hugged her tightly as he would never let her go "I was so scared."
Mary looked at Charlie and asked, "Why?"
"I was so scared you wouldn't remember me."
"Why wouldn't I?" she smiled firmly and tapped him on the shoulder. Then she rolled his eyes and said, "You've changed. We last saw you three years ago, didn't we? Before coming here˝
˝three years? ˝
"Isn't that so?" She thought for a while. “It's been three years. After our wedding with Paul. By the way, Paul is also looking forward to you. I finished my work ... ˝
"Wait a second" Charlie's voice sounded like he had just woken up. Tired and cloudy. “Paul? You? Wedding?. What are you talking about, Mary?“
The joy on the face of Mary suddenly disappeared. "Our wedding... Paul and me. Charlie, you were here with us. What happened to you?"
"What happened to me? Don't you remember anything?”
"What should I remember, I don't understand you."
˝Mary we found writings which belong to Einstein in Germany, in the Museum. Then we found a large piece of stone, the remnants which are found in the Philadelphia experiment. Then we learned that the stone was not a stone, but a petrified liquid. We did the same thing in the documents and found a way to go back in time. Since we could not study the composition of the liquid, we had a chance to do it only twice. We have already spent one, and ... ˝
˝Charlie, what are you talking about?”
˝Mary˝
˝Charlie ... We have never been to Germany˝
Charlie's eyelids trembled. "Oh my God. What have I done?" He said. Without taking his eyes off the Mary  he said “I can't do that”
When he opened his eyes, he saw two blurred faces above his head. Then, as the surroundings slowly cleared, he saw Paul and Saman looking at him anxiously and immediately stood up.
"Are you okay, Charlie?"
˝Where are we? ˝ He felt cold sweat on his body. He looked around. Nothing had changed. The lab, where it all started, returned to the room.
"How do you feel?"
"Nothing has changed?" Paul looked at Mary like a frightened child.
"No, Charlie” Paul replied. 
Mary looked at the phone nervously and said ˝the war did not erase from the history˝. He looked with hopeless eyes, "Charlie, you didn't succeed, did you?"
Charlie looked into Mary's eyes and said nothing for a few seconds. "No, I couldn't” he lied,  The security was stronger than we thought. 
˝You did what you can. do not be upset, honey˝ Mary took Charlie's hand helped him to stand up. 
“I wish I could do it“ 
˝We will” Mary said with enthusiasm “we have one more attempt”
His body trembled as he breathed. He did not know how to say that he used the second substance. "I'm sorry."
˝Oh. Honey do not be˝
"There is no second attempt"
˝What do you mean? We have one more liquid left ˝
˝Mary. I went back not once, but twice˝
˝I gave you a second substance for emergency situations. And you used it? Why?˝ 
"I went back for the first time and killed him. But when I came back, everything had changed”
˝And? ˝ Mary was still very worried about Charlie.
"Except for me," said Charlie. "Everything changed, Even ... ˝ He touched Mary's hair ˝You”
“What do you mean? ˝
˝You and Paul ... Got married. You chose him”
Paul swallowed the piece of donut in his mouth. He said, "I better get going."
"Then you used the rest of the substance so that the future would remain as it is. You had a chance to save the lives of millions of innocent people. But you turned it down. Just for me?
˝Mary˝ Charlie's voice was trembling, sweat was slowly trickling down his cheeks from his forehead. “Look, I couldn't bear the fact that the outside is beautiful, but my inner world is in disarray.”
"You are the most selfish, most disgusting man I know," said Mary, tears welling up in her eyes.
"Mary, please…”
Mary threw her white robe and left the room.
Mary stood up when she heard the knock on the door. She immediately put on his nightgown and ran to the door.
Charlie's hair clung to his forehead from sweat. He had a small tablet in his hand.
˝What are you doing here? ˝ Mary asked with a puzzled expression.
"I have been calling you for 2 days. Please give me two minutes." I can fix everything
Mary opened the door to the end. "It's only two minutes," she said.
˝You know how much I love you..˝
˝ You lost 10 seconds already˝
"Blood plasma," said Charlie. He continued to speak quickly so as not to lose a second. “All four doses of the substance are injected into my blood. And less than 24 hours have passed. If we take plasma from my blood and filter that substance in it, we can get at least as much of that substance as we can go back again˝
The wrinkles on Mary's face slowly began to open.
˝But this time I will do something different˝
"What is it?"
˝I was the only one who remembered that we loved each other. But if you come with me, then when we come back, we will both remember˝
˝We need to wake up Paul urgently, you call him and I will take the necessary equipment and go to the laboratory˝ Mary said immediately forgetting all anger. 
Unlike Charlie, Mary fell to the ground on his back. "Aaaahhh" Then she gathered all his strength.
Charlie immediately stood up and adjusted the same waiter's dress. Then he took Mary's hand, lifted her. "You'll be waiting here."
˝No, what are you talking about, Charlie? I'm coming with you too”
"It's dangerous”
"That's why we're going together."
Charlie sighed and said, "Okay, we must be here as soon as I finish. We will have a few seconds to return to the cabin”
Mary and Charlie entered the restaurant. Mary was looking at Charlie from the corner. When Himmler pointed to Charlie, Mary's heart was pounding. Charlie leaned over Himmler, listened to him, and shook his head.
Then, as he followed Himmler, he looked up at Mary and pointed to the right side of his head, the toilet. Then he pulled out his weapon.
Hitler looked into Mary's eyes before being shot in the head. When he saw Hitler bleeding from the middle of his forehead, screams were heard in the whole restaurant.
˝RUUN!˝ Charlie shouted. 
Gathering all his strength, she ran to the toilet. When he heard the shots, She turned his head and stopped. Charlie grabbed Mary's hand and dragged him to the toilet, almost cutting his legs off the ground. Then, as he entered the last cabin, He clung to Mary's shoulders. "Listen to me now, we don't have time," he said
˝I know˝ Mary took out a small circular device ˝Open a shirt we need to find the vein quickly˝
˝Mary! ˝ 
Mary finally looked into Charlie's eyes. 
"I can't come."
"What are you talking about?"
˝I dropped my substance”
˝Charlie˝ The Mary feels the heat on his cheeks, ˝Charlie what did you do?”
Charlie grabbed Mary’s cheeks forced her to look at him. "Mary, you have to go”
"Why are you doing this?" Mary's eyes were so full of tears that he could see Charlie blurred.
"One of us has to make sacrifices to make a world a better place to live”
"Don't say that”
He opened the arm of the Mary and inserted the needle tip of the device into her vein.
The sound of gunfire was heard. They looked at each other. 
"They're here," he said. Charlie looked at the woman he loved for the last time. He smiled with tears in his eyes ˝One of us must make sacrifices to save the world, humanity, millions of innocent lives” he said.
"Charlie, I can't live without you."
˝If you can't live without me, then live for me, Mary. I love you˝ When Charlie pressed the button, Mary saw for a moment that the surroundings were suddenly white.
The Mary did not move after hitting the ground. Mary stared at the ceiling without blinking. Maybe the circle light will open again, and Charlie will return. But it didn't happen. She came out of the door with tears that did not dry, she looked around carefully. The city had changed. She stood and looked around at the world that Charlie had sacrificed. The Mary stopped for a few seconds. She remembered the last word of him "One of us has to sacrifice for the world to make it a better place”
She looked at the city and whispered “God! What a Day“
<|endoftext|>
My final exam for General Biology is first thing tomorrow morning, Fern lectured herself sternly. I really should go back to my dorm and study. I’ll never keep that A average if I don’t ace this exam. The biological sciences department is so competitive and I won’t have a chance of progressing towards a career in biotech unless I maintain a high GPA in my life-science classes.
Yet Fern couldn’t quite find the willpower to make herself rise from the soft towel spread on the outskirts of the quad lawn. Her skin still ached for the sensual caress of the torrid tendrils of sunlight. For the last four months, ever since returning from winter break, Fern had been questioning what had possessed her to pick a university that was located so far north. Although her mother had warned her, she hadn’t truly appreciated how different winter here was from her home in southern Florida; the precious, golden sun was locked away in an impenetrable vault of gloomy clouds and guarded by intense snow squalls all the way into early May. Fern had never before felt as if it were possible to starve from lack of sunlight. Even if it wasn’t that warm and patches of mud lingered from the recent snow-melt, she couldn’t understand why all the other students hadn’t joined her to bask in the luscious rays arrowing downwards from the chariot of the resplendent, reappeared Helios. Perhaps she should consider transferring to avoid being forced to spend another winter in this bitter, bone-chilling Niflheim. Focus on biology for now, she told herself. The exam for Comparative Mythology isn’t until next week.
Yet Fern would still need good grades on both exams to succeed in transferring somewhere both competitive and warmer. Just a few more minutes, she told herself. Reluctantly, she decided that she could still mentally review core concepts while lying in the sun even if she hadn’t toted the heavy textbook to the quad along with her.
Photosynthesis: the process by which plants utilize sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate oxygen and glucose, she began.
As raw material to fuel the process, the plant draws in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Carbon dioxide is easy enough to find, Fern thought sadly, since we humans go out of our way to make so much of it. But if it’s a colorless and odorless gas, how do plants know when they have enough to use for photosynthesis? Or have they just evolved with the assumption that we’ve polluted the air everywhere?
Soil… Idly, without opening her eyes, Fern stretched out her left leg and poked her bare toes into the ground. Unexpectedly, she encountered a mud puddle. Letting out a little squeak at the cold, squelchy sensation as the mud surrounded her big toe, she nearly jerked her foot away instinctively. I wonder if plants hate the first thaw as much as we do, she wondered. If they sleep all winter, only to awaken in spring, do they ever feel their roots get cold? It’s not as if they can scrunch their rootlets up to huddle together the way that I can curl my toes.
Yet, as her ambient body heat slowly warmed the mud, Fern found the contact growing more pleasant. It was as if she could sense the dormant nutrients drowsing in the soil; as the soil heated, they would escape from the chunky frozen clumps of winter to become free-floating and porous. Soon enough they would be ready to be sponged up by a plant the same way her dry winter skin sucked in vitamins from a moisturizing mask. No longer slimy, the mud felt enriched and restorative. It almost seemed alive itself.
First stage of photosynthesis: light-dependent reactions. Light-dependent reactions require the presence of a constant source of sunlight throughout the process and begin when a plant cell’s chlorophyll, located in the chloroplasts, absorbs sunlight, Fern recited to herself. Chlorophyll is the pigment that makes plants appear green by absorbing light on the red and blue parts of the spectrum. What would she look like if she was green like a plant? Fern contemplated playfully. Certainly it would be much harder to find appropriate foundation and flattering eye and lip palettes. Human skin tones obviously reflected light on the red part of the light spectrum.
But more than that, under the skin, how would it feel to be a plant full of chlorophyll? Since it was technically a pigment, would one’s flesh always be smooth and hydrated? Or would she even notice its presence at all since it lurked at a cellular level?
Focus, Fern, she reprimanded herself.
The sunlight excites the chlorophyll, which then splits water molecules to form the gas oxygen as a by-product. If a plant had any awareness, what sensations would the plant experience as it drank in energy? Would it be as simple as the pleasant warmth that Fern felt now, heating her skin and penetrating to the flesh beneath to relax tense muscles? Would a plant’s leaves tingle with a faint bio-electrical shock as it took in energy? Did a plant ever feel like it was sunburning? Perhaps the plant would delight in the same combination of relaxation and invigoration that now left her feeling both boneless and hyper-attuned to the world around her.
No, Fern decided, that didn’t sound right. Since the excited chlorophyll split water molecules to form gas, the plant would probably feel jumpy, the way she did after too many coffees in one afternoon. And full of gas, like she’d been after the third day in a row of having tacos at the cafeteria last week. Giggling, Fern imagined a bloated plant leaf with a tiny belly letting out flatulent little burps and farts that were too soft for humans to hear. Except that the plant was expelling oxygen and not hydrogen sulfide, so its farts wouldn’t stink like Fern’s awful roommate’s did. How did a tiny blond sorority girl manage to spew so much foul air? Us stupid humans depend on plant farts to breathe, Fern thought to herself mirthfully. That should tell us our real significance in the universe.
The plant cell generates ATP and NADPH, which are molecules that the plant uses to store that light energy for the second stage of photosynthesis. The sugars that actually nourish the plant are not created during this stage of photosynthesis, she continued, dragging her thoughts away from both her roommate and philosophy. Fern had initially struggled with the distinction the textbook made between energy and nourishment. Finally, she’d simply decided to analogize it to her cell phone charging until it had a full battery. Being permeated by energy in the first stage of photosynthesis didn’t itself do anything to ease the plant’s hunger, but it then had enough battery power to call out for delivery.
If I were a plant, she speculated whimsically, what type of take-out would I like? Pizza, but with no meat toppings, she decided. Maybe broccoli or spinach. Or would that be plant-cannibalism? Fern’s own stomach gurgled faintly as she thought longingly of slippery, melted cheese and the smell of freshly baked, piping hot crust. Unfortunately, she’d already finished the entire napkin of food she’d purloined from the cafeteria for her impromptu spring picnic lunch. Fern promised herself a snack once she had gathered enough energy to go back to her dorm. Again, she chortled silently at her own silly imagination: plants didn’t have mouths! Sadly, no pizza for them! And if she wanted any food soon herself, she’d better finish up.
During the second stage of photosynthesis, light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle, take place. The plant cell transforms the ATP and NADPH produced by the first stage of of photosynthesis into food. This phase of the process does not require an active, consistent source of sunlight but still occurs during daytime. The plant cell uses carbon dioxide and the ATP and NADPH to manufacture RuBP and glucose.
Deciding that she’d soaked in enough sunlight for today, her bones finally feeling fully warmed through to their core, Fern pulled her toes out of the mud and stood up. Or she tried to. When she started to tug, she encountered unexpected resistance. Although the mud still felt damp, it was as if it had dried around her foot, holding her in place. Confused and frustrated, Fern pulled harder, then gasped as she experienced an oddly painful sensation at the tip of her toes, as if she were trying to snap her end-knuckles loose.
Or she tried to gasp. Her mouth never opened. In fact, it was as if her entire oral cavity had grown completely shut, her lips sealed. Though she certainly made a mighty effort, she discovered quickly that screaming was both impossible and useless.
Truly alarmed by the unpleasant, hallucinatory turn her thoughts had taken, Fern attempted to wrench open her eyes. Yet, like her mouth, they refused to respond. Actually, it was worse than a mere refusal to open; although she still felt the sunlight pouring down on her skin, there wasn’t even a bit of light visible through the crack between her eyelashes or the thin, delicate flesh of her eyelids. Her entire field of vision appeared a uniform black. Surely she should at least see a faintly red haze from the sun even through her closed eyes! Nor did Fern feel even the slightest twitch of the sensitive muscles of her eyes and eyelids despite her now terrified efforts to lift those heavy lids. Panic flooded her as she realized that she was now effectively blind.
Her next impulse was to lift her hands, lying relaxed at her sides, to peel off whatever impossible obstructions had covered her facial orifices. Yet, like her eyes, her arms refused to rise. It was almost as if Fern was yanking on a slack rope that wasn’t attached to anything: she couldn’t get any traction, as if the underlying muscle structure in her arms no longer existed at all. Now that she’d turned her attention to her arms, Fern abruptly realized that she felt dirt surrounding her fingertips, as if they had somehow lengthened and burrowed into the earth next to the towel, although she hadn’t been touching the dirt before. What is going on here? She thought in frightened confusion.
It was an unpleasant non-surprise when Fern tried to move her legs and discovered that they were in exactly the same condition as her arms. Not only was she blind and mute, but she was also immobile!
After what felt like an eternity, Fern gave up on struggling when she failed to move even a single part of her body. A helpless lassitude filled her and sapped her willpower: what was the point? Every effort was a mere waste of energy.
Distantly, she knew she should be alarmed by the fact that if she couldn’t move, she couldn’t breathe. Yet she didn’t feel as if she was in any distress. Her chest did not ache, even if it didn’t rise and fall in a normal breathing pattern. The racing of Fern’s frantically pounding heartbeat began to slow gradually. Yet Fern simply didn’t have enough vigor left to panic again when she realized that the sound had faded beneath the threshold of her perception. The comforting and constant pulse of flowing blood that had accompanied her through her entire life seemed to have ceased completely.
Was she dying? Why? Somehow, she would have thought it would have been a more painful process. Surely somebody passing through the quad would notice her limp body! Hopefully they would find her in time to save her life!
Focusing on the last sense left to her, Fern strained to hear anything at all. Even as her hearing grew dim, she heard a faint, girlish voice exclaim, “What an odd-looking shrub! And how did those old clothes and that towel get tangled in its roots?” Fern felt pressure brush against first her arched back and then the side of her arm.
Help me! She wanted to scream. Stop worrying about whatever stupid plant you’re looking at! How are you not seeing me lying here?
“Careful, now!” the voice continued. “We don’t want to uproot it by accident!”
Suddenly, there was no obstruction between the surface of her back and the rich soil beneath. Obeying a primal impulse as darkness closed in around her mind, Fern delved deeper into the welcoming earth.
“There you go! Grow, little plant, grow! That yucky litter is all gone now.” Those were the last words Fern heard with human ears.
<|endoftext|>
The sun hasn’t shown in one-hundred years. The light was long ago blocked out by human over-consumption and pollution. As a child my mother would tell me stories of a foreign heat that would radiate from the sky. I would imagine myself standing on a hill looking out over a vast land, lit up by the light as far as I could see. Little fur covered animals would dart back and forth across the hill. A flower covered tree with a swing fashioned to a low hanging branch would sway in the breeze. I would imagine my mother’s description of warmth tickling my skin as I snuggled into my blankets. She would kiss me on the head and whisper, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight” every night before I drifted off to dream of her fairytale world.
I’ve never seen land before, other than in the few illustrations hung in the Light and Land archives hall. Maybe my mother added fantastical elements to her stories for my benefit. I don’t see how a ball of gas makes colors in the sky, how water droplets form floating white pillars in the sky, or how the light would make food grow. We’ve had food for a hundred years without the light. My mother’s stories of beasts great and small, naked and furred are another topic I’m sure she concocted for my amusement. I would often wonder if the land would also change colors with the light’s mood. Does the light hurt the way fire does? I had an active imagination and unending questions as a child.
But I am grown now. No one has seen the light in years. I don’t have the energy to mull up questions and childish fantasies anymore. I push those thoughts and memories aside as I shuffle down the narrow, dank corridor to my duty station. Another eighteen hours of laundering duty uniforms. This shift, I’m assigned to scrubbing a pungent, black ichor from week old trousers. The smell of the ichor elicits a gag as the chemical burns my eyes and nose. I repress my repulsion as I plunge my hands into the slimy muck. I won’t be getting this smell off of my skin or curls for a week, I sigh. And I won’t have time to scrub the ichor off my skin, change my clothes and douse myself in scented oils before the Counsel’s special announcement meeting after my shift has ended. I guess I’ll, once again, be lingering on the wall with the rest of the lower stationed workers. At least then my odor will meld into theirs until the source is unrecognizable. 
I wiped the sweat from my forehead with the back of my arm, smudging ichor down the side of my face as I made my way toward the corridor. Tahir was leaning casually against the wall waiting for me. The exhaustion of eighteen hours of work melted away as I took in Tahir’s tall, lean muscled body. His swooping black hair that clung to the edges of his perfectly squared jaw accented the one-sided grin he gave me as I approached him. “You look like you took a roll in the sewer” Tahir joked as he smudged the ichor down my face before brushing stray strands of loose curls from my face. “And smell like it too” he laughed. “And you, as usual, are a prick, Tahir” I countered before placing a kiss on those full lips.
Tahir and I took our places quietly on the wall at the back. No one acknowledged our presence, to my satisfaction, or seemed to notice the stench above all the other marrying smells. As per usual, the meeting drug on and on for what seemed like unending hours. I couldn’t decipher anything The Council were announcing from the distraction of Tahir’s arm brushing against mine. Only the occasional few words would register, “Not safe”, “still toxic”, “further food rationing” and the occasional hacking cough of another citizen.
The Council finally wrapped up the meeting, exiting through back doors in a sea of billowing blue robes before the citizens departed. Tahir took my hand in his. The scratch of calluses from years of laboring in the iron mill tickled my palms. He looked at me sidelong before we dashed down an empty corridor towards the large air vent in the wall. Our make-shift jig was still safely tucked behind a loose brick in the wall. Tahir and I have been exploring the shafts and taverns beyond the compound vents for years. We found our secret place when we were children. The tick of dripping water lured us to the warm pool of water dripping down the side of stone in an underground cavern. “The cavern must be fed by fresh air from the compound and closed off from the toxic air outside,” Tahir had concluded.
As children it was our secret, safe haven and play house. We would spend hours swimming, laughing, splashing and dreaming of a world beyond our own. Now it served a different purpose, reserved for secret lovers and stolen kisses. A small chamber all our own, away from prying eyes where he and I could forget our worries and get lost in each other’s bodies.
Tahir scooped water into a bucket for me to clean myself without sullying the pool. I scraped soap and a soapstone across my arms, peeling the ichor from my skin layer by layer. Small rudimentary candles lit and lining the rocks around the pool cast a yellow glow around Tahir’s chiseled torso and accenting small burn marks scattered across his body. He lounged on a rock patiently waiting for me. Chuckling when I would get frustrated with the ichor refusing to peel from my skin. Tahir padded silently over to me, taking the soap and stone in his hand he turned me around “let me help you” he whispered against my neck. Small goose bumps travelled down my arms as his hot breath caressed my skin. “Washing is so much more fun when you’re not doing it alone”.
Hours went by lost in each other’s embrace. The warm water licking away the sweat from our entanglement. Weariness was starting to resurface from the ever-increasing duty hours. The weight of Tahir pressed my back firmly against the cool stone sending a shocking contrast swirling down my spine. It was a nice contrast to the heat still throbbing between my legs. Wrapped in his arms I almost forgot about my hopelessness and exhaustion.
Resting my head against the chilled stone, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. Tahir laced sweet kisses down my throat saying barely above a whisper, “Why so quiet today?” I couldn’t put my feelings into words. I was just simply empty. I had been hollowed for a long time, since my mother passed and probably before then, too. But today felt different. I had given up hope that the Council would have better news of the outside and had come to expect increasing rations. But even expecting it, it just hit differently this time.
Opening my eyes, I let my jaw go lax, hoping the feelings would turn to words and float out on a breath. I stared blankly at the stone ceiling of our safe place. A small light flicked on and off. I must be exhausted if I’m seeing things now too. But the light flicked again. I blinked back the exhaustion and squinted to look again. It was still there. A small hair-line crack the size of a finger nail glinted like a candle.
“Do you see that?” I said as I shoved away Tahir’s kisses. “I see you. What else could I want to see?” He said reaching for me again. I pushed his hand away, annoyed at his one-track mind. “No, Tahir, I’m telling you I just saw something on the ceiling. Like a flashing little light on the ceiling. It’s never been there before.” “This again, Creada? There is nothing there. There is no more light. I know you want it to be there and if it were then in a way your mother would still be with you through her fantasies. But it was just a story and riddle of a dreamer.” He replied. “How dare you,” I yelped shoving him away more forcibly now. “It’s not some story of a raving lunatic.”
Stalking from the pool I snatched up my clothes and strode towards the narrow exit. The ground slammed into my face. Looking around in confusion I saw the brown rope sticking out of the ground. “What is this?” I said. Tahir approached, stifling a laugh. He bent down and ran a callused hand over the protrusion. “Hmm, that is weird. I’ve never seen anything like it. It almost looks like the depictions of a plant root from the old world. But it can’t be. Creada, don’t go there right now. I’m sure there is a perfectly sensible explanation.” “You’re right, Tahir, there is a perfectly sensible explanation and I’m going to find exactly what that is.”
We walked back to our quarters in silence. The only sound my mother’s words replaying in my mind on repeat, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.” Tomorrow I would find the answers. Tomorrow I would show Tahir that my mother wasn’t raving. He would see. There were still unexplored vents to explore. If we could find the pool then maybe those shafts could lead to more answers.
The morning alarms came quickly. I jumped from my cot and slipped into my ratty trousers. Tahir was already waiting for me in the corridor. “I already checked both of us out of duty today.” I told him. “Tahir ran his hands over his face. “Is this about the exhaustion hallucination from last night? Please tell me this isn’t about that?” He pleaded. “That’s exactly what this is about. But if it helps then think of it as reliving our childhood years because today, we are going through the air shafts we haven’t explored yet. You can just think of it as an adventure” I told him.
We made our way to a smaller shaft at the end of an unused corridor. After prying the cover off we crawled through the small opening. “Well, at least I get a nice view.” Tahir chuckled. This shaft wasn’t like the other shafts. This one was smaller and angled steeply upward. Bracing my hands on the sides of the cold vent we started our ascent. The shaft seemed to go on forever. Finally, it stopped. I looked around for any crossing shafts or intake fans from the air room. Nothing. Just a steep drop into nothing.
Sighing, I braced myself for my potential death as I let go and plunged towards the ground. To my surprise and gratitude, the fall wasn’t more than eight feet. Tahir was still in the shaft calling out to me, “Creada? Oh my God. Creada! Please answer me. Are you alright?” “I’m alright.” I called back. “It’s a short drop. Just jump down here.”
Tahir landed with a soft thud next to me. “Is it just me or does this space feel like it’s more open?” Tahir whispered. “Let me find my light.” I said as I fished my pop-up lantern out of my back pocket. The room was bigger. Much bigger. My arms couldn’t touch both walls outstretched. There was no space this big in all the compound aside from the Councils meeting hall. At the end of the room ahead we spotted a small wooden door. “Now, that’s strange.” Tahir said to no one in particular. “Who would put a random room and door in the middle of nowhere?”
“That’s exactly the kind of thing I plan to find out.” I said as I headed for the small door. With a forcible shove we had the door open. Beyond the misplaced door was an even larger room and metal cubes lining the far wall. Something moved in the dark beyond my small light. Voices carried through the room. They were getting closer and louder. I grabbed Tahir’s shirt and lunged behind a support pillar. “Light, Creada! Put the light out!” pleaded Tahir.
We sat in the darkness of the room barely breathing as the voices drew closer. “We have to do something; they’re getting too frail. Soon there won’t be enough food for everyone” a familiar voice said. Keres. I would recognize that voice anywhere. She was our head Council. Well at least its good to know they’re concerned about the rations. Food was getting scarce. My bony ribs were proof of that. Keres continued, “and who will replace them without notice? We can’t let this get out, there would be a rebellion. And most importantly we cannot let the past repeat itself. It must be protected”
My head was beginning to spin. My body felt like it was removed from my soul. Who are they talking about replacing? We sat in the dark long after the foot steps retreated and disappeared. “Tahir, we have to move on. There is something more happening here.” Tahir only nodded in agreement as I relit our light.
The small metal cubes sat at the far end of the room. As we approached, I realized they were not cubes, but cages. Half starved men sat, cramped in the cages. I couldn’t believe what my mind was telling me my eyes were seeing. The men’s gazes only followed us. No one spoke a word. I stopped before the smallest of cages. Bile was building in my throat. I swallowed my disgust and placed a hand on the bars. “Who are you? What is this place?” I asked. The man didn’t answer. He just opened his mouth revealing rotting teeth and Oh god, his tongue was missing. A mute. “Crap.” Tahir gasped. “We won’t be getting answers from any of them.
The man pointed toward another door before him. The same direction Keres and her associate travelled. I couldn’t go through there. Keres and my sure death could be awaiting me on the other side. The man kept pointing and moaning louder and louder now. “Shh.” I warned him. “You’ll get us found.” The man only rattled his chains in response.
Tahir was still standing behind me, face ashen. “Tahir, we can’t leave these men here.” I cried. “We have to find a way to free them” Hot tears were blurring my vision now and dropping in big puddles on the ground. Tahir slowly looked down at me. Reality slammed back into his vacant eyes. “No Creada, we need to go through that door. There is something he needs in there. Maybe it’s the answer to our questions.” Tahir replied.
Dusting the dirt from my shaking knees I stood and Tahir took my hand. “One look.” I told him. We pushed through the large doors. I held my breath as the aged wood creaked in protest. The hinges squealed as the door came to a stop. But there was nothing there. No answers awaited us behind this door. Only a small hatch lay before us.
One more door I thought. We had come this far; we couldn’t turn back now. I unlatched the small door and held my breath. I pushed the small door open. But a white light poured into the cavern. I was blind. This was it. My end. White light blasted over and through me. Wet heat rushed over my skin. A moisture pooled on my skin. I cried out and covered my face with my arm. I wasn’t dead yet. At least I didn’t feel dead. Slowly I cracked open my eyes. Confusion replaced fear. White, warm light stretched as far as I could see. Green swayed back and forth at my feet. Trees dotted the expanse covered in an array of greens and little flowers. My mother’s words echoed in my mind, “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.”
My hand slowly crept over my mouth. My mother’s stories were right. The light did exist. They hid it away from us. I could be free. The light called to me, drawing me out of the cavern. The green on the ground tickled the soles of my feet and up my legs. Free. The light was real. It’s all real. I looked at Tahir and he looked at me. Apology unspoken in his eyes. A smile crept across my face. Tahir’s mouth was moving. What was he saying? “Run!” Tahir’s words echoed in my ears. Then I heard it. The shouting voices behind us. “Run Creada!” He screamed again as he wrapped his hand in mine. The door slammed behind us. And we ran. Into the light. Into freedom. We ran as the suns heat tingled across our skin. Real. Free. “Creada, have faith, look out for the light, sleep tight and let it guide you from your plight.” My mother’s words guided me. Free. And I would come back for them. The shadows could not hide the light anymore.

"I remember the first day," he said without taking his eyes off the substance. "I asked you What is your plan. KillingHitler?” Paul smiled.
"Your reaction was more fun when we answered YES," Charlie replied with a smile.
"But to be honest," Paul looked at Mary ˝I think that would be better if we go back to learn something about history, instead of changing it”
"We can stay there for only 5 minutes," replied Charlie.˝We have a chance to change history in such a short time, why not make it man?!˝
"Because the consequences will be severe." Among the three friends, Paul always took the negative aspects of the issue first.
“Man, we are almost at the end of the plan˝ Charlie injected the dark blue substance into his vein and put the empty bottle on the table.
“How can you ignore the Philadelphia experiment˝ Paul said
˝Paul, come on, are we really start all over again?“ Mary murmured. 
˝Paul, We all decided to take the risk˝ Charlie supported Mary.
"That's not the point," Paul murmured. 
˝Paul is too late to change something˝ Mary approached the computer next to the device. She took a deep breath and pressed the enter key. 
In front of the mirror, Charlie adjusted the collars of his shirts by looking at the pictures of the waiters in the German restaurants of 1941-1945. "I think it ready˝
"İt's the same." She filtered Charlie from head to toe and raised her thumbs in the air. Then she opened her hands and said, "You’re ready to serve Hitler“
Charlie was looking at Mary's hands. As usual, he narrowed his small eyes and clenched his jaw. Slowly he approached her and touched her dark brown hair. "You're nervous," he said.
The light on her face suddenly disappeared. "I think we should not ignore what Paul said, but ..."
˝Mary˝ Charlie spoke patiently as usual. He wiped Mary's tears with his thumb and kissed her softly on the lips. ˝Everything will be fine. I promise˝
˝So˝ Paul emphasized ˝How does it feel to be a hero that no one will ever remember?˝
He checked the gun for the last time and fastened it to the rear belt. “One of us must put our hand under the stone”
"The molecules will be active for 4 minutes and 37 seconds when you go there," Mary said, giving him a small round iron device with a button. “When you come back, inject this cord straight into your veins and push the button˝
˝Location specified. 1939. You are going to Munich. The name of the restaurant is Bürgerbräukeller“ Paul connected the computer to the device.
Charlie tried to hide his tension with a smile. He suddenly felt a great pain in his body. He felt an electric current in his veins. All around turned white light. And .... ˝
There was a mix of almost all colors around him while hitting on the walls in the darkness. A strong wind was blowing on his face. It was as if he had jumped from a height of thousands of meters without a parachute. Suddenly all the colors disappeared. A large circle opened. He sighed as he slammed to the ground. He tried to soothe his pain, saying, "My arm!!!” Then he opened his eyes. There was a sharp smell of chlorine in his nose. Then he looked to the right and then to the left. He could not blink. The floor and walls were paved with small white tiles, grayish-white, and small rectangular. It was old, but somehow very new. Charlie stood up. He was greeted by the reflection in the first mirror. Suddenly, a man came out of the gray door behind him, and Charlie lost his temper and turned around. The man in the soldier's uniform looked at him for a second and got out. Charlie looked in the mirror. His cheeks were flushed as if he had been drunk. 
“We made it", with a stupid smile on his face. 
Immediately after crossing the narrow corridor, Charlie stopped and looked around as if cold water had been splashed on his face. There were innumerable large brown tables in the hall. Small chandeliers on the ceiling hung in a row. Large red posters with Nazi symbols hung on the upper walls. In the middle of the restaurant, large Nazi flags hung in front of each other.
It was almost impossible to hear the sound of jazz music from the noise of people in military uniforms sitting at the table. 
Suddenly there was silence. Everyone stood up. All the waiters stood in the corner of the table, holding their small golden trays. Charlie quickly went to one of the tables and stood like them. Then he saw him in the distance. Hitler looked thinner and smaller than he looked in the pictures. 
He was still in shock, a small gold tray trembling in the middle of his palm.
After Hitler sat down, everyone sat down. The sound of jazz music slowly began to be heard again. When Charlie approached the ear of the man sitting next to Hitler and said something, he listened to him carefully and shook his head. Charlie looked at his watch. 1 minute 47 seconds left. He had to do what he had to do now. If he did not return in time, he would spend the rest of his life in Germany in 1939. Heinrich Himmler looked around. Then, when he came face to face with Charlie, he had difficulty holding the tray. He could feel his heart beating in his brain. Himmler called him. As Charlie approached him, Himmler said something in German. Charlie shook his head, but he did not understand anything. After Himmler had finished, Charlie stood up and looked at Hitler.
Now or Never
Then he slowly walked around the table and peered at Hitler with the tip of his eye. 
He then pulled out a gun and drilled a hole in Hitler's head. Charlie did not know that he would be so fast. For a second, the surroundings became blurred, and everyone's movement became heavier. Hitler's head slammed into a white plate on the table. Screams and gunshots were heard around. Charlie threw himself on the sidewalk. Then he took out a small round device from his pocket. Hearing the sounds of running and screaming, he got up again and entered the middle cabin in the toilet. Then he took the device out of the hole and tried to find the vein by squeezing his hand before inserting the needle. The toilet door slammed. The needle slipped out of his hand. They were already inside. Then, when he took out the needle and tried again, he finally found his vein. Three bullets hit the right cabin. Then the door slammed. Charlie pressed the red button. The German military pointed the weapon at him and yelled something in german. Then suddenly the image began to disappear. Charlie looked at his hands. Again the same strange colors. German officer stepped back in fear. Suddenly, everything turned black and white.
This time Charlie hit the ground on his right side. "Mary! You could have thought of that” he muttered. He looked at the white walls around him. There was nothing in the room but large windows.
He hurried down the stairs and opened the door, he smelled cool, freshly cut grass. Charlie was in the city where he was born and raised, but something made him feel very different. It was possible to breathe deeper and more comfortably than ever. As he walked slowly along the sidewalk, there was a smile on the faces of the people who came face to face with him. Charlie saw different types of model cars on the road. He quickly approached and picked up one of the hanging newspapers. "Thank God," he murmured ˝I'm back on time," he said, looking at the headlines on the front page
March 12, 2022
TODAY IS 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORLD WITH ONLY CLEAN ENERGY
THE LAST STAGES IN THE FORMATION OF A SINGLE WORLD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED.
Charlie got into one of the roadside taxis. 
"We have never had an employee named Mary Atkinson," the receptionist said in the laboratory. 
Charlie's grandmother opened the door. He hugged her and immediately "You look different," was her grandmother's first words. "The clothes..." she asked carefully. "seems cool”
After an artificial smile, Charlie asked his grandmother, "Where is the Mary?"
˝Did she comes back from Ukraine? ˝
“Ukraine?“
“Yeah. I think you know that?”
"Why did she go here?" Charlie asked, ignoring his grandmother's suspicions.
"For Chernobyl," she continued to look at his grandson, with interest. "At the nuclear power plant."
Charlie came forward from the table ˝The accident did not happen?˝
˝What accident?˝ grandmother jumped up.
Then, looking at the teacup, he whispered, "Butterfly effect."
"Charlie, what is happening?" 
"I have to go to Ukraine urgently." Charlie stood up.
Charlie was very excited when he entered the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. It was one of the most beautiful places Charlie had ever seen.
˝Charlie!!˝ Mary shook hands from a distance, quickly approached Charlie, and hugged him. 
Charlie hugged her tightly as he would never let her go "I was so scared."
Mary looked at Charlie and asked, "Why?"
"I was so scared you wouldn't remember me."
"Why wouldn't I?" she smiled firmly and tapped him on the shoulder. Then she rolled his eyes and said, "You've changed. We last saw you three years ago, didn't we? Before coming here˝
˝three years? ˝
"Isn't that so?" She thought for a while. “It's been three years. After our wedding with Paul. By the way, Paul is also looking forward to you. I finished my work ... ˝
"Wait a second" Charlie's voice sounded like he had just woken up. Tired and cloudy. “Paul? You? Wedding?. What are you talking about, Mary?“
The joy on the face of Mary suddenly disappeared. "Our wedding... Paul and me. Charlie, you were here with us. What happened to you?"
"What happened to me? Don't you remember anything?”
"What should I remember, I don't understand you."
˝Mary we found writings which belong to Einstein in Germany, in the Museum. Then we found a large piece of stone, the remnants which are found in the Philadelphia experiment. Then we learned that the stone was not a stone, but a petrified liquid. We did the same thing in the documents and found a way to go back in time. Since we could not study the composition of the liquid, we had a chance to do it only twice. We have already spent one, and ... ˝
˝Charlie, what are you talking about?”
˝Mary˝
˝Charlie ... We have never been to Germany˝
Charlie's eyelids trembled. "Oh my God. What have I done?" He said. Without taking his eyes off the Mary  he said “I can't do that”
When he opened his eyes, he saw two blurred faces above his head. Then, as the surroundings slowly cleared, he saw Paul and Saman looking at him anxiously and immediately stood up.
"Are you okay, Charlie?"
˝Where are we? ˝ He felt cold sweat on his body. He looked around. Nothing had changed. The lab, where it all started, returned to the room.
"How do you feel?"
"Nothing has changed?" Paul looked at Mary like a frightened child.
"No, Charlie” Paul replied. 
Mary looked at the phone nervously and said ˝the war did not erase from the history˝. He looked with hopeless eyes, "Charlie, you didn't succeed, did you?"
Charlie looked into Mary's eyes and said nothing for a few seconds. "No, I couldn't” he lied,  The security was stronger than we thought. 
˝You did what you can. do not be upset, honey˝ Mary took Charlie's hand helped him to stand up. 
“I wish I could do it“ 
˝We will” Mary said with enthusiasm “we have one more attempt”
His body trembled as he breathed. He did not know how to say that he used the second substance. "I'm sorry."
˝Oh. Honey do not be˝
"There is no second attempt"
˝What do you mean? We have one more liquid left ˝
˝Mary. I went back not once, but twice˝
˝I gave you a second substance for emergency situations. And you used it? Why?˝ 
"I went back for the first time and killed him. But when I came back, everything had changed”
˝And? ˝ Mary was still very worried about Charlie.
"Except for me," said Charlie. "Everything changed, Even ... ˝ He touched Mary's hair ˝You”
“What do you mean? ˝
˝You and Paul ... Got married. You chose him”
Paul swallowed the piece of donut in his mouth. He said, "I better get going."
"Then you used the rest of the substance so that the future would remain as it is. You had a chance to save the lives of millions of innocent people. But you turned it down. Just for me?
˝Mary˝ Charlie's voice was trembling, sweat was slowly trickling down his cheeks from his forehead. “Look, I couldn't bear the fact that the outside is beautiful, but my inner world is in disarray.”
"You are the most selfish, most disgusting man I know," said Mary, tears welling up in her eyes.
"Mary, please…”
Mary threw her white robe and left the room.
Mary stood up when she heard the knock on the door. She immediately put on his nightgown and ran to the door.
Charlie's hair clung to his forehead from sweat. He had a small tablet in his hand.
˝What are you doing here? ˝ Mary asked with a puzzled expression.
"I have been calling you for 2 days. Please give me two minutes." I can fix everything
Mary opened the door to the end. "It's only two minutes," she said.
˝You know how much I love you..˝
˝ You lost 10 seconds already˝
"Blood plasma," said Charlie. He continued to speak quickly so as not to lose a second. “All four doses of the substance are injected into my blood. And less than 24 hours have passed. If we take plasma from my blood and filter that substance in it, we can get at least as much of that substance as we can go back again˝
The wrinkles on Mary's face slowly began to open.
˝But this time I will do something different˝
"What is it?"
˝I was the only one who remembered that we loved each other. But if you come with me, then when we come back, we will both remember˝
˝We need to wake up Paul urgently, you call him and I will take the necessary equipment and go to the laboratory˝ Mary said immediately forgetting all anger. 
Unlike Charlie, Mary fell to the ground on his back. "Aaaahhh" Then she gathered all his strength.
Charlie immediately stood up and adjusted the same waiter's dress. Then he took Mary's hand, lifted her. "You'll be waiting here."
˝No, what are you talking about, Charlie? I'm coming with you too”
"It's dangerous”
"That's why we're going together."
Charlie sighed and said, "Okay, we must be here as soon as I finish. We will have a few seconds to return to the cabin”
Mary and Charlie entered the restaurant. Mary was looking at Charlie from the corner. When Himmler pointed to Charlie, Mary's heart was pounding. Charlie leaned over Himmler, listened to him, and shook his head.
Then, as he followed Himmler, he looked up at Mary and pointed to the right side of his head, the toilet. Then he pulled out his weapon.
Hitler looked into Mary's eyes before being shot in the head. When he saw Hitler bleeding from the middle of his forehead, screams were heard in the whole restaurant.
˝RUUN!˝ Charlie shouted. 
Gathering all his strength, she ran to the toilet. When he heard the shots, She turned his head and stopped. Charlie grabbed Mary's hand and dragged him to the toilet, almost cutting his legs off the ground. Then, as he entered the last cabin, He clung to Mary's shoulders. "Listen to me now, we don't have time," he said
˝I know˝ Mary took out a small circular device ˝Open a shirt we need to find the vein quickly˝
˝Mary! ˝ 
Mary finally looked into Charlie's eyes. 
"I can't come."
"What are you talking about?"
˝I dropped my substance”
˝Charlie˝ The Mary feels the heat on his cheeks, ˝Charlie what did you do?”
Charlie grabbed Mary’s cheeks forced her to look at him. "Mary, you have to go”
"Why are you doing this?" Mary's eyes were so full of tears that he could see Charlie blurred.
"One of us has to make sacrifices to make a world a better place to live”
"Don't say that”
He opened the arm of the Mary and inserted the needle tip of the device into her vein.
The sound of gunfire was heard. They looked at each other. 
"They're here," he said. Charlie looked at the woman he loved for the last time. He smiled with tears in his eyes ˝One of us must make sacrifices to save the world, humanity, millions of innocent lives” he said.
"Charlie, I can't live without you."
˝If you can't live without me, then live for me, Mary. I love you˝ When Charlie pressed the button, Mary saw for a moment that the surroundings were suddenly white.
The Mary did not move after hitting the ground. Mary stared at the ceiling without blinking. Maybe the circle light will open again, and Charlie will return. But it didn't happen. She came out of the door with tears that did not dry, she looked around carefully. The city had changed. She stood and looked around at the world that Charlie had sacrificed. The Mary stopped for a few seconds. She remembered the last word of him "One of us has to sacrifice for the world to make it a better place”
She looked at the city and whispered “God! What a Day“

Sleep
Nolan Lucas opens his eyes and immediately starts looking around his bedroom. For the past 6 months this has become his normal morning routine. Most people might grab their phone and check their social media or sit up with their eyes still half closed cursing the start of a new day. Nolan no longer has any social media accounts. He had Facebook which he at one point did use pretty regularly. Grabbing his phone from his nightstand and checking to see if anything good was going down in the World of Facebook was how he started his days. But those days feel like a lifetime ago. In some ways it was a lifetime ago. Actually, it was a different life in all ways. Most parents who lose a child will tell you that their life has completely changed. And that was true. Nolan has had a number of counselling sessions dealing with the fact that his life has dramatically changed in a way no parent can ever imagine. But this was different.
Ceiling fan. Bedside table. Dresser. Closet door.. No changes. The big things rarely change. The one time a major object changed was the time he finally acknowledged that something was happening. It was easy to tell himself he was going crazy after the car accident that stole his five year old daughter from him two years ago. That type of trauma that would cause anyone to go crazy. Not to mention the lack of sleep since that time and no one would fault him for falling off the deep end. Then his wife leaving him 3 months later after the accident because in her words, “Its just too much.” 
Anyone in their right mind would lose their right mind. But it was his dresser that had always been under the bedroom window. One morning he woke up and it was no longer under the window that looked out onto his backyard. Where his daughter's Playskool princess castle still sat and as far as he was concerned always will. 
When the smaller objects would change you found a way to justify them. One morning he woke up and the purple walls that he painted because it was his wife’s favourite colour was suddenly a different shade. He remembered picking the darker purple although he had no choice in the colour he was at least given the responsibility to choose which shade his bedroom walls would become. The dark purple walls were now a light shade of purple.  A few weeks later as he was laying in his bed forcing himself to get up he noticed his ceiling fan looked different. “You never had a design on you,” he said out loud to his once plain white ceiling fan. 
But what it all meant? Not a whole lot as far as Nolan was concerned. What exactly did it matter anyway? But why it’s happening is something he could not get past. It's like having a popcorn kernel stuck between your teeth. It didn't change your day to day life in any meaningful way but you still could not help thinking about it. And even when you weren't thinking about it you’d still catch yourself trying to get at it with your tongue. Until you were finally forced to stop whatever you are doing and remove the annoyance any way possible. The dresser being against the opposite wall that one morning became Nolan’s popcorn kernel. He grabbed his phone from his bedside table and instead of browsing Facebook like he would in that past life, he found his way down a rabbit hole. The crazier the explanation got, the more it began to make sense. Well, maybe not make sense. It was all as far away from making sense as you could possibly get. As an adult you tend to think you know exactly how the world works. It's fun to think of magic and the paranormal being real as a kid. But as you get older you start to realize none of that is actually real. After four hours of reading about the same thing happening to other people, he came to the conclusion that when he would go to sleep, sometimes he would wake up in a different reality. How it happens no one really seems to know. The differences between realities are often so small that most people would not notice them and if you did you’d just convince yourself you're imagining things. 
Over the past six weeks Nolan woke up on three different occasions to minor changes. One morning he woke to a book he had never seen before sitting on his dresser. Two mornings later the book was gone. Then a week ago he went to bed wearing his favourite Metallica t-shirt and woke up wearing a Guns n’ Roses shirt. He wasn’t sure if he should consider the overnight wardrobe shift as a major change but ended up labelling it minor because it really made no difference in the grand scheme of life. And the more he thought about it, the more he realized even the moving dresser wasn’t that major. It was definitely interesting and the fact he was able to unwittingly slip into a new reality at random was something he never would’ve believed possible. But once he left his bedroom and continued on with his life nothing was all that different. Until two days ago. The last time he went to sleep. That was a major change.
The routine each morning was the same. Open eyes and look at the ceiling fan. Since he always slept on his back that was the first thing he would see. Then turn to his right and  look at his bedside table. Then make his way around the room with his eyes. On this morning he didn't even reach the first step with the eyes. This morning he didn’t need to use his eyes to see the change. This time he felt the difference. The thought of looking at the fan or checking the colour of his walls didn’t matter. Why those insignificant changes meant so much to him before he couldn’t say. When you sleep in the same bed with someone for years and then one day you start sleeping alone the emptiness becomes almost unbearable. Laying there motionless with his eyes still closed he reached out with his left arm that felt way too heavy. Feeling like his heart was about to explode out of his chest. His shaking, sweaty hand landed on a shoulder.
“Just five more minutes mom,” the unmistakable voice said. Nolan had heard his wife say this so many times over the years whenever he would wake her up. Still not wanting to open his eyes he told himself he had finally lost it. After all he had gone through the last couple of  years his mind had cracked and who could blame him? As he laid there, the sound of a door opened from down the hall. A sound he hadn’t heard in two years. A sound that he continued hearing for months after the accident. A sound that he missed every single morning he woke up alone is his bed. His eyes were still closed but he could feel the tears starting to fill them up.
Footsteps.
Tiny Footsteps.
Slowly coming down the hall towards his bedroom.
When you live alone you get used to the feeling of an empty house. Sensing someone laying beside him was unmistakable. So was the sense of someone standing at the end of his bed.
“Morning daddy.”
He didn't realize how tense his whole body had become until he heard his daughter's voice. He opened his eyes, releasing the ocean of tears he had contained in his tightly closed eyelids. Still holding onto his wife's bare shoulder, he saw his beautiful little girl smiling at him at the side of his bed. He knew at that moment that he could ever take the chance of going to sleep ever again and he was okay with that.

For twelve days, Seyla had stopped spinning. The planet drifted in orbit around the twin stars Solaris and Helios, but always with the same face to the suns. This astrophysical Anomaly had not only toppled the prevalent theory of gravity, but had relegated half the globe to permanent night, the other half to perpetual day.
The light side of Seyla faced certain doom. The globe had ceased to rotate during the middle of summer, and the blazing glare from the twin suns was now responsible for inducing mass insomnia in the night-starved people, who had been named the Populations of Light. Seyla’s light side was threatened with drought. Water rationing was already being discussed and Almeida, the Queen-Empress of Seyla, knew the desperate thirst of the light-side inhabitants would soon lead to civil strife as they competed for fresh water—which was already of questionable quality and scarce on the planet years before it had stopped spinning.
The Populations of Night faced their own dilemmas. Darkness-induced mood disorders had destabilized many of Seyla’s night-ensconced inhabitants. What could one do? Stay indoors as much as possible to avoid the “lunatic deviants,” as Almeida had taken to calling those constituents of the Populations of Night who resorted to crime as a means to cope with the psychological pressures of living in a perennial penumbra. The massive amounts of energy consumed to keep the darkened lands’ industries going and cities lit threatened to deplete the world’s already scant fuel reserves.
As inhabitants of Seyla clamored for the edge zones of the planet, where permanent dawn and dusk provided relief for those who ventured there, the mass migrations contributed to the social distress on the newly divided world. Something needed to be done, and the Oracle was consulted.  
Seyla had stopped rotating on its axis when the imperial palace was enveloped in darkness. In the palace, Almeida had given birth to her third child. The planetary citizenry had rejoiced and celebrated the official announcement of the sex of Almeida’s unborn child. The Queen-Empress’ two previous children had been male, which had left the matriarchy with no successors, but with the birth of Reyna, Seyla’s supreme monarch had secured the continued rule of her lineage. The arrival of the new royal progeny promised continued peace and prosperity for Seylans. The coincidence of the birth of the baby girl and the cessation of planetary rotation was declared auspicious.
“You have had an enlightened tenancy of the throne, Queen-Empress,” the Oracle said in their non-binary, machine-generated voice. You have been patient, tolerant, and lenient where other Queen-Empresses have not. Seylans love you.”
“What has caused The Anomaly?” Almeida asked.
The Oracle approached her from within the confines of their mechanized wheelchair, and with their usual impassive facial expression, continued, “You have conducted no wars, as previous rulers have. You have banished most serious illnesses and increased life expectancy. You have ensured material plenty for all.”  
“Is Reyna the cause of the planet’s static orbit?” Almeida queried again, impatient with the Oracle’s praises.
“Seylans have prospered. They have been fruitful and multiplied as the sands of the growing deserts. Seyla itself, however…” Here the Oracle paused.
Almeida knew where the Oracle was going next with their discourse.
“Seyla itself, is in danger. A meager and precarious portion of its original plant and animal species remain. The unchecked efforts to extract and fabricate fuels has upset the balance of Seylan nature. Material plenty is causing the planet to choke on the by-products of industrial production. As Seylans have multiplied, similar to the sands of the dry lands, so has the pernicious waste on the planet.”
“I have not had the fortitude to enact strict population management on Seyla,” Almeida said. “Many generations of my predecessors taught that there is no greater joy than the bringing of a new child to the world. Children are hope embodied. They bring the best out in parents, in siblings, in people, in civilizations. Joyful children are the guarantee of a joyful future.”
“Queen-Empress,” the Oracle responded, “Seylans have been under the spell of the joyful child cult your progenitors lavishly promoted for centuries. They regard and defend no right with as much determination as that which guarantees a joyful life to as many children as those Seylans of reproductive age are willing to have. The only way to return the cycles of night and day to the planet is by making a draconian population management decree.”
“Seylans will never agree to it,” said Almeida.
“They will only do so if their illustrious Queen-Empress leads by example and makes an unforgettable sacrifice,” said the digitized voice of the Oracle. “The Anomaly will end once the planet is rid of Reyna and a one-child decree is made.” 
The sacrifice will not only be unforgettable, thought Almeida, most Seylans will consider it unforgiveable.
For the duration of what had been formerly three days and three nights, the sunlight- deprived Almeida and her advisers, anguished over how to resolve the dilemma posed by the life of the royal newborn. Killing Reyna would lead to massive unrest, Seylans would call for Almeida’s head, the reign of peaceful plenty would come to a revolutionary and catastrophic end. Two centuries of enlightened rule would end in bloodshed and chaos.
Almeida’s junior advisers proposed faking an accidental death for the child, leaving it in the middle of one of Seyla’s shrinking wildernesses, or abandoning Reyna in a city teeming with adherents of the joyful child cult, where she would readily and lovingly be adopted. 
The Queen-Empress knew, however, that the Oracle did not mince words. They had said the planet needed to be rid of the royal infant.
The Queen-Empress’ most senior adviser, Mathilde, came up with the solution. 
“Despite decades of attempts, Seylans, inhabitants of the eighth planet, have not been able to land on, Aegypticus, the ninth planet from our twin suns. As a memento of this continued effort, as a gesture of hope and goodwill, Reyna must be delivered to Aegytpicus.”   
Almeida tore at her hair and savagely beat her breast from grief, but also from realization that this was the most reasonable and least cruel of her advisers’ suggestions.
In response to the grave and transparent declaration of the child’s immanent ejection from their world, all Seylans communed in mourning.
Costly preparations were made. There was not a single adult Seylan who did not want to belong to the crew of the spacecraft or be one of the royal child’s wetnurse attendants on the interplanetary voyage. The Queen-Empress’ subjects knew the survival of Reyna was as unlikely as the continued existence of civilized Seyla if the planet did not begin rotating again. All Seylans resigned themselves to the tragedy, and those who were not yet parents vowed to commemorate Reyna’s departure into the unknown by vowing to have no more than one child each.
On the fortieth day of the Anomaly, as the spacecraft with its precious cargo rumbled up and out of the Seylan atmosphere, planetary rotation resumed. Balance was restored. Dusk gradually became night again for the Populations of the Light, and dawn steadily became day again for the Populations of the Night.

The smell of ash riddled the cave, lights fading as the torches were snuffed out. This world is not my own, I don’t know how long it’s been since I ended up here, but I’m beginning to lose hope of ever returning to my own world.
The sun is bright today, the streets are busy and full of people shopping, running late to work, delivering food. Of course Japan is always busy, no matter which part of the country you go to, everyone is either working or planning to work. I’m on my way to a very important meeting. My company is about to close on the biggest deal it’s ever seen, and I’m the man that’s going to do it! My phone begins to ring, I grab it from my pocket.
“It’s Kaneshiro, I wonder what he wants.”
Kaneshiro is my best friend, we’ve practically been friends since we were born. We’ve done everything together our whole lives. Our career choices went totally different though, I went into business and Kaneshiro, well he went into a different kind of business.
“Hello?” I answer.
“Ban! Hey Ban! It’s Kaneshiro!”
“Yes, I have caller ID Kaneshiro, what’s up? I’ve got a meeting I’m heading to.”
Kaneshiro takes a deep breath.
“Ban, it’s done.”
“What’s don-“
“The game my company has been working on, it’s done!”
I let out a gasp. The game that Kaneshiro’s company has been working on is one of the most highly sought after titles of our generation. It’s an RPG, Open World, Level Grinding masterpiece that I have been lucky to see behind the scenes on for the past three years of production.
“No way! Warriors of Hikaru is done!?” I shout.
Kaneshiro lets out an excited laugh.
“Once you’re done with your meeting, stop by my office and I’ll let you get your hands on it!”
Kaneshiro hangs up the phone. I drop my phone back into my jacket pocket. I can’t believe the game is done, and I have to go to this meeting. When I say our careers went differently, I’d say Kaneshiro got the better end of the deal.
Well, this is it, this is the place the client requested to meet. This hotel is way out of my price range, that’s for sure. A tall man wearing all black opens the door for me. I straighten my tie, take a deep breath and step through the door.
The light, where did the light go? It’s so dark. I turn around and the door is no longer there. What happened? Where am I? Suddenly a very faint light appears, flickering, it’s a torch.
“Hello?” I mutter.
The torch stops moving. Suddenly it begins to head toward me. I can start to make out a figure holding the torch, it’s a man…a man in…armor? What is going on?
The man stops directly in front of me, he stares at me for a moment.
“You smell of them, who are you?” He asks in a very deep, growl.
“Hello…um, my name is Ban Haru…I am supposed to meet a client here to discuss a business partnership.” I extend my hand out to shake his.
The giant man looks at my hand and back at me.
“No idea what a business client is. But a partnership could be helpful. Perhaps not by someone who looks like them” He turns and begins to walk away.
I slowly follow him as he is the only one with a light and possibly my way out of wherever it is I am.
“You think I have a bizarre fashion sense? You’re the one in the samurai armor. What is this? The Edo Period?” I chuckle.
The man is silent, looks back at me and growls lowly.
“I haven’t seen anyone smile for long time. Much less laugh.”
“Um, why is that?” I ask curiously.
“Not much funny, not much to smile about.”
We finally reach the end of this dark tunnel, I expect to see tables and chairs, possibly reception. It’s the outside, there are trees, I feel the wind, I smell….ash?
“What’s burning?” I ask the man.
“Everything burn, only way for light.” He points to his torch.
I look around me and I can see ash flakes falling, I look up and see just grey, there is no sky. If there is, it’s under a very thick layer of smoke.
“What is this place? Where are we?” I ask.
The man continues to walk and to check his torch.
“We are in Japan. Do you not know this?” He looks back at me.
“No, this doesn’t feel like where I’m from. Did I get knocked out? Am I dreaming?” I pull out my phone to check my service.
No service. The man looks back at me and notices my phone. He rushes over to me and grabs it.
“Magic!? You’re with them!?” He goes to throw my phone on the ground.
I snatch my phone out of his hands.
“Magic? Them? What? No, this is a phone, it’s not magic, I’m not with anybody. What are you talking about?”
“You not with them, but you still carry their magic. You have the same uniform. Who are you?” He is practically touching my face with his.
“I told you my name already, and I don’t know where I am right now, I walked through a door and I was just in that dark cave with you. That’s all I know, I swear.”
“You really do not know where you are. I can tell you are not full of deception.”
“Thank you.” I release a sigh of relief. “Knowing where I am would be pretty great though.”
The man looks up to the ash cloud filled sky.
“This is Hikaru No Mura. It is my home, or was. This is what is left of it. Much was destroyed once the men with magic appeared. We had light, and peace. Now, nothing but darkness and war.” He looks at me. “You do not know the magic men?”
I shake my head no.
”Hikaru No Mura? I know that name, why do I know that name?” I look around and begin to see familiar landmarks. This is THE Hikaru No Mura. The samurai village in Japan. It’s said to be the most preserved village filled with the most preserved samurai history, showing their architecture and buildings. This is different though, because this isn’t preserved, this is mostly destroyed. “What happened here?” I ask.
“The magic men came, they left the village a gift, an egg made of steel. They used a tool like yours, they told us that our gift would be explained in a days time. I had been out hunting for food for the village, I saw a bright ball of light in the sky above, then I was hit by a wave of warm wind. Then, everything went dark and I have not seen the light since.”
Hikaru No Mura roughly translates to The Village of Light. How fitting that some sort of light destroyed it, now the light is taken away from this land. I don’t know how long I’m going to be stuck here, so it’s in my best interest to find out what happened here. I also need to be careful, because this is obviously not my time period. I somehow got sucked into a glitch in time and got transported back to what I assume is close to the Edo period given the clothing and the structures.
“Someone is coming! It may be magic men.” The samurai grabs my shoulder and pulls me into a patch of grass.
It’s like he said, two men are walking through the village.
“Well, the test went as expected, the whole village was wiped out, everyone and everything. The Village of Light is now The Village of Darkness.”
I know that voice. That’s…
“Kaneshiro?” I stand up.
Kaneshiro looks at me.
“Ban?” He mutters. “What…how…are you here?”
“I don’t know, I stepped through the door to my meeting and I was in a cave with, well a samurai.” The samurai stands up next to me.
Kaneshiro looks at the samurai. “Fascinating, you survived. You’re the only one that has survived every single time we have run this test. How do you keep doing that?”
“Um…Kaneshiro…what do you mean? You did this? You killed all of these people? With light? What are you talking about?” I point towards the carnage of The Village of Light.
“Ban, there’s something you’re missing. It’s very important. None of these people are real, I’m not sure how you ended up here with us, but this is my game. The one I’ve been working on. This is Warriors of Hikaru. My company has created a device that allows us to jump into the game. We’re able to just live the game to work out bugs, and glitches, see everything with our own eyes. It’s incredible.”
I look at Kaneshiro with disbelief, attempting to wrap my head around the sort of technology that would have to exist for something like that to be possible. If this is a game, none of these people are real, then, why does it all feel so real, why does the air smell like death? If there is no life here, why does it smell like death?
“Kaneshiro….”
“Yes, Ban?”
“What did you do to the village?”
“Oh, we just dropped a nuke on it. I wanted to see what would happen. Cheat codes, you know?” He smiles.
“Kaneshiro, are you sure this place isn’t real? Do you smell the death? The blood? Do you have any idea what you’ve done to these people? Look around you Kaneshiro, this place is real. I don’t know what you did, or how you did it, but this isn’t a game. This is…..real. All of it.”
“Look, Ban, the first time I traveled here, I thought it was real too, but my people assured me, that it was the game. I’m not lying to you Ban. I promise.”
“But were you lied to….Kaneshiro?” I look at him.
The man he is with, a guard most likely. He pulls a gun out and begins firing at me and the Samurai.
Kaneshiro flinches at the sudden shots fired.
“What the hell are you doing!?” He shouts.
The samurai grabs me and throws me into a hut.
“Magic men, they are liars, they do not think we are real people? What does that even mean!?” He pulls out his sword.
I still hear Kaneshiro shouting at the man, who is still firing his gun at the hut. Suddenly a blue light shines through the window, the firing has ceased. Kaneshiro is silent. I look around and I’m in an empty lobby. Lights are out, no one around.
“What?” I mutter.
Suddenly my phone is ringing. It’s Kaneshiro.
“Hello?” I answer.
“Ban, I don’t know what that was about, I don’t know why you were there, I don’t know anything. Please, come to my office. Let’s talk.” Kaneshiro hangs up.
With an offer like that, how am I to refuse?
I arrive at Kaneshiro’s office. I reach the top floor and he’s there, waiting for me. He guides me to a chair in front of his desk, I don’t see the man that was with him in the village. I sit.
“Ban, what happened out there, none of that was real, it was just the game.” He clears his throat and his eyes are darting back and forth. “You do know that right?”
“That is what you said, isn’t it?”
This is all too suspicious. He’s acting weird.
“Kaneshiro, you’re acting weird. Are you okay?” I ask.
Kaneshiro looks up behind me. I turn around, it’s the man that was with him. He looks down at me, arms crossed. His demeanor isn’t very friendly.
“Kaneshiro, what’s going on?”
Kaneshiro sighs. “Believe me, I didn’t know. I wasn’t aware that place was real, I didn’t know we traveled back to the past, we killed actual people. I didn’t know. I thought it was my game. That’s what they told me. I hired an outside company to build a device to allow me to jump into my game and I was willing to pay whatever the price. I wanted to give the world a way to play the game that was more immersive than any current virtual reality sets we have. I wanted my game to be more. I didn’t know Ban.”
The man behind me pulls a handgun out.
“Wait, wait, wait, Kaneshiro, why do you need to kill me? Why tell me all of that if you were just going to kill me anyway?”
“Because Ban, it makes me feel better knowing that you knew I didn’t know it was a real place. I want you to remember me as a good person.”
The man puts the gun to the back of my head. I close my eyes, shivering. Scared. I’ve never been more scared in my life. He takes the gun away. I open my eyes.
“Ban, you won’t die if you promise me, that you won’t tell anyone about what you saw, what you experienced. Can you do that for me? Please, Ban?”
I look at Kaneshiro, tears in his eyes. He’s being truthful. I nod my head and he has me escorted out of the building.
….SIX MONTHS LATER…
I visit The Village of Light, it has been rebuilt since then. These people, they didn’t even know how to prepare for something like that. They weren’t prepared for modern day evil. A mother and child pass by me, I can overhear the child.
“The Warriors of Hikaru had a village just like this! It’s where a samurai stood up to the bad guys. He went to war with them and eventually won. He was able to find peace in knowing the bad men were put to rest. Once he took down the leader of these bad men, the light returned to his village, once the light returned, he knew he could rebuild!”
I smile and pat the statue of the Samurai, Ina Takesada. The warrior to singlehandedly bring back the light. Underneath his name is a caption.
“The Lost Light, Returned After Twelve Years, Thanks To This Brave Samurai.”
<|endoftext|>
You put the visor on first, like you have countless times before. It fits perfectly around your eyes and over the contours of your face, because it was made for your face, and you are sealed off into uninterrupted darkness. Then you feel for the headset in your lap and put that on, too, the cups firmly encasing each of your ears. Instantly the world goes silent, and the void is complete. You lean back in your chair, and it reclines with you.
“Play it,” you say. Your voice is loud and clear to the otherwise empty, sterile room, but to you it’s muffled. You hear it mainly through the vibrations in your jaw.
A cool voice speaks clearly to you from the darkness, right in your ear, “Which one, sir?”
“The same one.”
“Commencing in three, two, one…”
In the center of your vision, a speck of light grows quickly larger, as if you are flying into the scene from far away. There is a feeling like your ears are popping, and suddenly all the sound rushes in.
It’s morning and you’re in bed, looking at the sunlight on my back as I’m sleeping. You hear birds. You watch my body rise and fall gently with my breathing, memorizing the curves of my shoulder blades, seeing the way the silk of my nightgown barely touches my skin. The light crawls along my pillow, lighting up the specks of dust floating in the air. Eventually it reaches my face and I stir and roll onto my back, and you see my swollen belly, and your heart fills and spills over.
You can’t resist kissing me. You feel me smile against your lips, and then you see my eyelids open. You want to rub your beard all over my face the way you know I love it, you want to tickle me, you want to squeeze me and swallow me whole, but suddenly my eyes widen and you help me rush to the bathroom to pee.
We’re making breakfast together. I’m telling you a story about something I read, you stop me for a moment so you can run the coffee grinder. The beans are cacophonous, and then they are smooth and velvety. You take the lid off and let me smell the fresh grounds first, watching my eyes close involuntarily as I inhale. Then you ask me to continue what I was saying. You’re trying hard to focus, but you’re distracted by the way I peel and stem the mushrooms, the way I pick off the individual parsley leaves, the way I laugh so hard at my own story that you worry you’ll have to rush me to the bathroom to pee again.
The mushrooms hit the buttery pan, sizzling. The oatmeal bubbles thickly in the pot beside them, spicy with cinnamon. The sunlight catches the steam. You feel your mouth water.
Later you’re sitting at your desk, drawing on your upright tablet, answering emails, nodding along in virtual meetings. But mainly you’re watching me out of the corner of your eye, sitting at the desk next to yours. You try not to smile during one of these meetings when my toes find yours and try to play.
The sun moves across the sky, and at one point it gets in your eyes and you have to pull the shades down. You get up to make more coffee, but stop short of the kitchen because you see me in the living room, quietly dancing with my belly. Whispering to it. You feel your chest expanding and tightening at the same time, you can barely take it but you don’t want it to stop.
Before dinner we go for our walk down to the water. As we thread along the winding gravel road, you talk about an issue you’re having with work. But you don’t really care about it. Mainly you watch me frown at the injustices and nod approvingly at your decisions, and you feel very supported. You breathe deep the crisp fall air and notice how bright the colors of the changing leaves are. A neighbor drives past and you wave.
Down at the water, everything is perfectly still. The lake is a mirror reflecting the forest on the other side, the sky above that’s started to turn bright pink and firey orange, clouds smeared and puffed and streaked and dusted across it. Some geese fly overhead, honking insistently. You take my hand. It’s cold, just as you suspected, so you warm it up in yours.
We start walking home just before the sun sets. Back on the winding road, a gust of wind blows past and shakes the leaves clinging to their trees. There is a sudden shower of red and gold. You feel me let go of your hand. You know I love trying to catch falling leaves before they land, but you wish you had stopped me this time. I’m laughing as I run back and forth erratically. You are also laughing, and you feel like the leaves are laughing, too.
The truck comes barreling around the bend.
“Stop,” you say to the recording. But it doesn’t.
You hear the tires screeching, you see me turn to look, you know what comes next: the glass breaking, the blood—
“Stop!” This time you shout. You rip the visor and headset off.
You’re back in the room, back in the chair. Your face is wet, you don’t know if you’re sweating or crying. It feels like you’re gasping for air through a thin straw. You hear screaming, but the headset is silent from where it sits, thrown onto the ground.
“Are you alright, sir?” The cool voice comes over unseen speakers in the room.
“Why didn’t you stop it?” You are trying not to shout.
“Sir, the doctor has advised it necessary for you to experience the recording in its entirety. By repeatedly ending it prematurely like this, you hinder progress. If you continue this behavior, we will have no choice but to terminate your sessions.”
You pick up the headset and visor and start to put them back on. “Play it again.”
“Sir, you have reached the end of your allotted time.”
You look at the visor in your hands.
“… Please,” you say, willing your voice to be steady, your breath to stop rattling.
Silence.
Then: “Commencing in three, two, one…”
It’s morning and you’re in bed, looking at the sunlight on my back as I’m sleeping. You hear birds. This time your vision is swimming.

2081
Zahara Colony
Artemis Site
Montel pulled the lever back to the off position, causing the drilling arm to stop. Before him was a once-pristine slab of rock now punctured by drill bits and heavy machinery. 
The cameras on the drilling rig zoomed in closer. Small slivers of reddish-pink minerals were now exposed. Arderium 2 was discovered during humanity’s first colonization attempt 52 years ago. This mineral was essential to NextGen hardware and computerized systems.
“Andromeda,” Montel said to his display monitors. 
A communication panel appeared.
“Yes, Montel,” replied the digital female voice.
“Call up Unit 249, to start the extraction process and deliver product to refinement.” 
“Right away,” she replied. 
“Hey, compa!” 
Montel swiveled in his seat. Normally, the computer did not use Zaharan slang. Then he realized it was coming from outside the cabin. Montel looked down from his rig.
“Hey, Montel, it’s chow time, compa!” Travis was waving him to come down. 
Montel locked his display and began to exit the drill rig cabin. He descended the yellow ladder attached to the rig platform and went to join Travis.
“Damn, it’s cold,” Montel said. 
“No shit, we’re 1,000 feet up. Hurry up, man!” Travis said, gesturing towards a utility elevator. 
They picked up the pace and took the elevator down to the common area, where there was heat and a mess hall. 
Inside, Montel sat at a table while Travis grabbed them some food. In his hand, he clasped a picture of him and his mother. She was dark and lovely, with beautifully coiled hair and a warm smile. Her life motto, ‘All things work together for good.’ However, for five years, he had been numb, ever since watching her die of cancer.
Many who worked in refinement, as she had, suffered similar fates. Their last days were spent fighting with insurance companies that refused to cover newer and more cutting-edge treatments, always insisting on generic care. All of this in the shadow of trillionaires who forgot how they became so, and a home planet that only cared about their latest products. Profits left Zahara but they didn’t stay there.
Travis returned with food. Montel started eating, as Travis fumbled in his pockets and retrieved a blue and red bottle. Anti-radiation meds.
“Ah, here you are.” 
Travis popped two pills and then started shaking the bottle furiously, realizing there were no more. 
“Shit!” 
“Those aren’t cheap,” said Montel.
“You don’t say!” 
Travis sighed and then looked hard at Montel.
“Hey, Montel … ” 
“No.”
“Come on, spot me a bottle I’ll pay you back.” 
“You know how difficult it is to get these!”
“But Montel … ” 
“If we both run out, we will fail our physical and then they’ll fire us.”
“I won’t let that happen! Besides, is working in New Stockton instead of the mines so bad?” 
“This is the heart of Zahara! I belong here!”
Travis nodded.
“At least spot me today’s dose. I’ll figure something out!” he insisted. 
Montel huffed angrily. He would do almost anything for Travis, but sometimes he pushed too far. 
Nevertheless, they were friends. He reached into his breast pocket and retrieved his bottle, thumbing out four more pills so Travis could complete his dose. Travis took the pills and downed them with coffee. 
“Did you see Salazar’s speech last night?” asked Montel.
“No, what did the old man say?” replied Travis.
“He’s taking the Zaharan Business Council to court about sharing more profits with the workers. They say the case has a chance.”
Travis laughed. 
“You don’t believe that, do you? Remember the toxic sludge scandal? Don’t even get me started on how they screwed up radiation shielding. It’s the reason we’re still popping these damn pills! I mean look at your mom’s … ” 
“Don’t be an asshole.” 
“Sorry, Montel. I know it still hurts.” 
“I’m just saying. It feels like Zaharans are finally pushing back. Getting more of the pie from Earth,” said Montel. 
Travis laughed again. 
“Montel, I love you, like a brother. But sometimes you’re too soft. We going to get the pie when we take it!” 
Loud boos filled the hall as digital wall screens played a news grab from Earth. On screen was the Secretary General surrounded by five Mega CEOs or Oligarchs, as they were known to many. Montel recognized Amjad Kumar, the trillionaire mining investor.
“Today at UN headquarters in Kyiv, the Secretary General and business leaders announced a new wave of investment in the Zahara colony and Luna.”
Kumar went to the podium.
“I thank the Secretary General for her support on the 2090 Outer Planets Investment Strategy. Together we will generate more prosperity for all of Earth and our citizens throughout the galaxy!” 
The other executives clapped, reveling in the excellence of their thinking. 
“Forget those bastards, let’s get back to work,” said Travis. 
After working eight more hours, Montel left for home. At the base of the mountains was a hangar bay filled with low flyers to take workers back to New Stockton, Zahara’s capital.
The flyers were small, silver-colored ten-seaters with surprisingly comfortable seats. As they flew, Montel stared out at the countryside of his home planet, a vibrant mix of colors and landscapes, mountains and forests. The transport dropped him off at his house in new Stockton. Montel knocked on the door of the house. Nobody answered. 
“Karina must be asleep,” he muttered, as he took out a key. 
Montel entered the house and went straight to the refrigeration unit, eager to pop open a beer. 
He stopped upon hearing sobs from one of the bedrooms. Montel followed the weeping to his son Ivan’s bedroom. Karina was standing outside the door, crying, watching Ivan sleep. Montel put his hand on her shoulder. 
“Amor, what’s wrong?” he said. 
“Oh! Oh, my God!” she said, trying to quieten her tears. “He’s asleep.” She took his hand and led him back into the living room area. They sat down on a sofa. 
“Is something wrong?” persisted Montel.
“Ivan is sick.”
“What do you mean ‘sick’?” he demanded. 
“He has cancer, stage four.”
“What do you mean?”
“They think there was some toxic sludge near the play area at the school. Radiation readings are high there.”
“What? What do you mean ‘cancer’? I thought the school had radiation shielding? What the hell is this!” 
“Don’t shout!” she said.
Montel stood up angrily and began pacing the room.
“Amor, Amor, try to calm down.”
Sensing he was close to panic, Montel sat back down. 
“Doctor Reynolds says it’s bad, but cancer treatment is better now. There’s new technology that can kill the cancer and keep him alive.”
“How much is that gonna cost?” 
“Is that all you can think about right now? Money! Our son is in trouble! We’re going to do whatever it takes!” 
Montel wrapped his arms around her. 
“Karina, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”  
Montel didn’t sleep all night, remembering his mother’s struggles. He would not let the same happen to Ivan. 
The next morning, Montel got up at 5 o’clock, shooting a stimulant before he left the house. 
After arriving at the mine, he went to the workers’ utility elevator. Five other people joined him inside. 
Montel’s phone pulsed in his pocket. Alert, department meeting in the common area. Montel groaned, as did the other workers. They all went into the small auditorium area and sat on the benches. Montel sat next to Ezra and Travis. 
“Fellas,” he said, shaking their hands.
Montel sat.
“What you think this is about?” asked Ezra. 
“Not sure,” replied Montel.
“I hear it’s a bunch of managers from Earth,” said Travis.
Just then, a side door opened and five people filed in: Bossman Wole, the mine administrator, and four others, who were clearly from Earth, their hands gripping bottles of OxiGenRate, a medical juice blend to help newcomers’ bodies adjust to Zaharan air. They stopped at the podium and waited as a projector slid down behind them. 
Wole spoke first.
“Morning, compas.” He greeted them the Zaharan way, something he rarely did.
“Morning, Bossman!”
“We done good for the last three quarters, production is up 130%. In quarter 3, minerals from Zahara powered 15% of technical products on Earth and Luna. The Zaharan Business Council sends their regards and congratulations on this success.”
They did the obligatory clapping. Wole continued. 
“You should be proud ... But change is needed if we are to reach the 2090 investment goals and the vision of our Chief Investor Amjad Kumar. I have with me some of our management team from Los Angeles. Lindsay Kane will talk to you about those changes.”
A woman in a blue suit stepped to the podium and began to speak.
“It’s an exciting time for our company. We’re going faster and smarter into the future with the introduction of our newest technical unit. Introducing Sammy!” 
The projector turned on and images appeared of a metallic and plastic-blended man. 
“Sammy operates advanced drilling equipment and makes fine-tuned adjustments to meet the special working environment here on Zahara. Sammy combines human abilities with a computer’s processing power.”
It was a damn android, a damn mining android. 
“We project that, with Sammy, we will increase production by a further 500% and increase quarterly earnings.”
Travis stood up.
“Are you talking about bringing that thing here?” 
“Oh! I’m sorry, I wasn’t ready for questions. But yes, multiple units of Sammy will be delivered here in the coming five weeks.”
“How are we going to work with those things hanging around?” demanded Travis.
“Well, um, some workers will be let go, others reassigned.”
A rumble of anger filled the room. 
“What do you mean, ‘let go’! I’ve worked here for 15 years. I have family!” shouted Tobias, another worker. 
The workers began to boo in unison. 
Wole stepped forward. 
“There’s no need for this, compas. Change was always coming. We knew this!” 
Travis was having none of it.
“Don’t call us compas, Bossman! Not while you’re siding with them. Is your job on the line? Huh?”
Montel couldn’t sit any more. He got to his feet.
“I’ve done all this company asked, made investors lots of profits. My son is sick. How will he be taken care of if I am let go?” 
Lindsay continued.
“The company will cover all Kobra claims.” 
“My son is more than a Kobra claim!”
“Kobra doesn’t pay shit!” said Travis in agreement. 
“Watch your tone!” warned Wole. 
“No, Bossman! You watch yours! This is our mine! This is our money! And this is our planet!” 
“Travis!” 
“No, Wole! You’re done. All of you are done! Get them!” 
The workers chanted, “Kick their ass! Kick their ass! Kick their ass!” And suddenly dozens of workers were swarming onto the stage, smashing the podium, and grabbing Wole and his guests. Travis led them, directing them and urging them on.
“Find some rope!” he ordered.
Montel didn’t want to join in the beatdown, but he still wanted to help. He remembered he had some utility rope in his bag. 
“Here!” he shouted. “Here’s some rope!” 
The workers took the rope and tied the guests up. Attempts to fight back were suppressed by waves of kicks and punches. Wole and the guests were dragged into a utility closet and locked inside. Five workers guarded the entrance. 
In a few hours the workers controlled the entire facility. Travis took Wole’s old office, using it as a command post. The workers respected him and followed his orders. 
Montel felt uneasy. He joined Travis in the office. 
“Travis, what are we going to do now? We can’t keep the mine like this.” 
“We’re taking a stand, Montel. And we’re taking the pie for ourselves and our families. I talked to old man Salazar’s office; they’re with us.”
“To do what, Travis? Fight Earth? We can’t do that, compa!”
“The word ‘can’t’ is a noose designed to stifle and deprive us of what we deserve!”
Montel had never seen Travis like this. The fire in his words was frightening but also electrifying. 
“I’m just worried about how we get out of this.” 
Travis came close to Montel, putting his arm around his friend’s shoulder. 
“Remember, compa, they need Zahara more than Zahara needs them. They’ll negotiate.”
Montel sighed, nodding his head. 
“Now, how’s your son?” 
“He’s good, but he doesn’t have long. He’s got cancer.”
“Damn … Probably needs better treatment than shitty Kobra would cover!” 
“Yeah,” nodded Montel.
“We gonna take care of that,” replied Travis.
Ezra and Tobias rushed into the office, panting from their hard run. 
“Boss! Watch this!” shouted Tobias. 
Ezra turned on the digital screen in the office. A news grab from New Stockton appeared. It was Governor Salazar, the ‘old man’. They watched as he spoke.
“My friends, as you know, for years I have called for more investment into our communities. You know the troubles we face, building a new world. Zaharan profits belong on Zahara with Zaharan people. We say ‘no more’ to profit extraction!”
“That’s right! That’s right!” said Ezra. 
“News outlets on Earth are reporting on an attack at the Artemis mining site. We now have confirmation that, three hours ago, workers reclaimed the mine from Earth owners and management... ”
“Corporate must be watching the video feeds,” suggested Montel.
“Let them! They can’t change a damn thing!” said Travis.
Ezra’s phone started ringing and he stepped out to the take the call.
Salazar continued.
“They call it terrorism. Well, as Governor, I call it a special economic initiative. We support these heroes … ”
“Yes!” Throughout the complex, the workers whooped and cheered. 
Having the planetary government on their side would help a lot. 
“You see that! They’ll have to listen to us now!” said Travis.
Ezra returned to the office, excitement written all over his face.
“Boss! Boss!” he called out to Travis.
“Yeah?” 
“The old man’s office just called; they want us to take the Earth people to the capital. They’re going to use them to bargain.”
“Should we do that, Travis?” asked Tobias. 
“We can trust the old man, can’t we?” added Ezra. 
Travis took a moment to think.
“We will send three of the Earthers including the woman. Montel and Ezra, you take those three to Salazar. We’ll leave one here with Wole.”
Montel was shocked. Today was bad enough, but this was worse. 
“You’ll need this.” Tobias handed Montel a RAZOR Colt pistol, 40 rounds.
“You shot before?” he asked Montel.
“A little,” Montel answered, his heart beating faster. 
“They get funny? Point and shoot,” said Tobias, making finger guns.
“You good, compa?’ asked Travis.
“Yeah, boss!” replied Montel, taking the gun. 
Montel and Ezra led the hostages to the utility elevator and down to the hangar. Pangs of foreboding gripped Montel’s gut. This felt wrong, but he was in it now: what could he do?
One of the male hostages began to beg.
“What do you want? Please tell us! We can get you what you want!” 
Ezra punched him in the side. 
“Shut up!” 
“Is this helping your family?” Lindsay pleaded. “Doing this? Please stop.”
“Shut up!” repeated Ezra. 
They boarded the transport and Montel went to the cockpit. After programming the autopilot, the ship began to taxi out of the hangar. 
When Montel returned, Ezra was standing before the hostages, phone in hand. 
“Just got a message from the old man’s office. Earth ain’t cooperating. He says their bodies will make a better point.” 
“What?” Montel couldn’t believe what he was hearing. 
Ezra raised his pistol towards the hostages. They screamed and begged for mercy. 
“Put the gun down,” he ordered Ezra. 
“What? No!”
“I said put it down!” 
Montel closed the gap and seized Ezra’s hand, twisting the gun out of it as Ezra pushed back. He grabbed Montel from behind. Montel seized Ezra’s arm and flipped him over his shoulder. Ezra crashed into the ground.
“Stay down!”
Ezra didn’t listen and tried to get up. Montel kicked his head. Ezra lost consciousness immediately and collapsed.
“Oh, shit!” Montel cried out.
Steel-framed boots were not kind to human heads. Montel checked Ezra’s vitals; he was alive. But for how long?
He looked up at the hostages, elites whom he never trusted. Montel felt more worried than ever about the future. Still, he remembered what his mother would say: “Even in darkness, All things work together for good.” 
Montel stopped the ship. He left the hostages with autopilot programmed to a safer location. Then he and Ezra exited the ship.
Ezra survived but the cause did not. UN Marines arrived seven days later. Montel lost his job, and his assets were seized. All participants in the uprising were rounded up and jailed, awaiting extradition to Earth. 
Inside the crowded jail, Montel sat on a hard bench counting. He tried not to think about what awaited him on Earth or what would happen to his family.
The gate into the jail rattled open and three dark-suited women filed in. 
“Montel Almeida!” 
This was it. 
“Here,” he responded. 
A woman approached him, staring intensely.  
“I’m Myra with Outer Planet Security. You’re one of the hostage takers?” 
“I won’t speak about the case without representation from counsel,” he replied. 
“I understand but you won’t need it.” 
“What?” 
“The hostages spoke up for you, especially Lindsay Kane. You’re free to go.” 
The jail door slid open. 
“Well, then, I’ll be going,” he said. 
“Just one second,” said Myra. “Miss Lindsay Kane told me to give you this. To show that not everyone on Earth is a monster.” 
“I don’t want anything from her!” 
“It’s the condition of your release, take it.”
Montel took the brown envelope and left. It was true, he was free. Outside he began walking. After reaching a safe distance, he opened the envelope. Cash. Lots of it. More than he had ever seen. He fell to the street on his knees, overwhelmed by shock.
“What a day!” he cried out. 
The End
<|endoftext|>
I blinked as the last of the fluid drained from the tank, and looked out at the creature before me. It pushed a pair of lenses up its facial protrusion, the orbs behind them wide as they ran down my form and back up to my face.
It asked slowly, “Can you understand me?”
I watched its mouth move as it spoke. The words held meaning, but I wasn't sure why. I answered, "Yes…"
“My name is Doctor Gertrude Oddilair, but you can call me Trudy. Can you say Trudy?”
I thought for a moment. Was it a word? What was a word when it was attached to a person? Yes, but it was called something else … a name. Could my mouth form to say it? “Yes. I think so.”
The person released a low, trilling sound. I liked it. I repeated it, and Trudy suddenly stopped, replacing the sound with a sharp intake of air. “You’re laughing already! That’s impressive. But I do need you to repeat my name.”
“My name?”
Again, it laughed. “No. Say ‘Trudy’.”
I replied, “Trudy.” My eyes lowered to my hands, those strange appendages with multiple pieces holding them together. I flexed them, feeling something inside accommodate the motion. Looking up at Trudy, I asked, “What is my name?”
Its mouth widened. Its eyes crinkled as it pressed a button on the panel next to the tank. The smooth surface between us lifted, and, for the first time, I saw it with nothing between us.
Trudy stepped aside, gesturing out onto the floor. The air outside the tank was cold, but I followed its direction and stepped out onto the metal surface. Shivers spread through me, and I hugged my bare chest with arms still soaked in viscous liquid. As I stepped out of the tank, Trudy turned and walked away, addressing me as it went to touch the clear wall a short distance away. “I’ve been calling you MIST. It’s an acronym for Man-made Incorporeal Sentient Tele-consciousness.”
When it touched the wall, the room on the other side changed, becoming a reflection of the room I saw around me. Standing in the centre of the floor, in front of an empty pod, was a person. Human? It had pale skin, black hair, and a much flatter shape than Trudy.
“Man-made Incorporeal Sentient Tele-consciousness…” I muttered my whole name, never taking my eyes off the reflection. “You’re right, MIST is better.”
I tilted my head at the stranger in the wall. It tilted its head back, the same way. I moved my hand, and it followed. Trudy stood aside as I stepped toward it, and it stepped toward me. Trudy scribbled something down on its clipboard as I interacted with the other…
No. Wait.
We blinked at the same time.
“Do you recognize that person?” Trudy asked me after a long silence.
I glanced at it, then back at my reflection. “It’s me.”
“Good.” Trudy scribbled some more. “How do you know that?”
“I don’t know. It’s a feeling, I suppose. It moves like me.” I tilted my head as I looked down at my long, square body. It had curves, like Trudy, but it was different - maybe because it wasn’t covered by anything. Did Trudy look like this? I turned to the side, and looked myself up and down again. The more I looked, the more I recognized - and not just myself. The walls of the room I was in became more familiar; the temperature; the way the air touched my skin; Trudy; but most of all, the face looking back at me, with its pronounced nose and full lips; its dark, narrow eyes and sharp jawline.
The scratching on Trudy’s clipboard brought my attention back to it. As I looked up, it said, “So. You knew the person in the mirror was you. What else do you know? About you.”
“About me…” I looked down at my hands. They were large, and felt strong. All of me felt strong, yet … something was odd. The longer I looked at my hands, the more I saw the shaking: it wasn’t in my flesh, specifically, but deeper somehow. The word molecular touched my mind, and I looked up at Trudy with wide eyes. I could do … other things.
I was realising many things today - and on my first day. Was that something Trudy would consider interesting? As I closed my eyes, I felt the strangeness in a closer way. I felt it on my fingertips, in my mouth, on every inch of my skin, like something unseen. I tilted my head one way, then the next, as I tried to figure it out. Ah, yes. Soon, I started to understand it: the movement; the sensation; strangeness in and outside my skin.
I wanted to use it.
In that moment, I became nothing: my body split into a million tiny pieces, scattered like air itself. I hadn’t opened my eyes, but I saw Trudy. Its mouth was wide again; its eyes large and wet. Pink saturated its cheeks. Its clipboard and pen hung down by its sides as it turned frantically, calling out my name.
I wanted to tell it I was still there. I wanted it to know there was nothing to worry about; to see where I was.  As soon as the thought entered my mind, my form moved to encompass Trudy. My intent melded with Trudy’s, and hers with mine. I felt her wonder, her excitement. I understood then, I was wrong about her fear. She was amazed at me; she was proud. She wanted to see more - so together we changed the room around us. I showed her what I saw and felt before I woke up - the darkness, the cold - and she responded with loneliness. Sadness. In turn, she showed me tall, shining towers - buildings - and planes, and crowds of people in Times Square. She showed me the world outside, everything I could see beyond the walls of this facility once my testing was over.
When we finished, I stumbled back into my human form, and almost fell. She caught me by the arm and pulled me back to balance with a sharp tug. We laughed together.
“Well, that’s it for today,” she said with a grin as she stepped away from me. “I have to get going and record all we learned today, but I’ll be back tomorrow. Don’t worry, you won’t have to go back in the pod - and we’ll get you some clothes.”
“Thank you.” I smiled, but it slipped away as her hand left mine. The thought of her leaving was not a pleasant one, but I knew I would see her again. As she left, she glanced over her shoulder to me and I felt my smile return. My chest warmed when she looked at me.
Some people in uniforms came into the lab later, and gave me a selection of clothes like theirs - pants and shirts, all different colours and materials. They moved me to a different room where there was no pod, but a bed. I slept comfortably, and my mind drifted into other worlds for hours at a time. 
For the next few weeks, Trudy came to see me every day, and she would study what I could do and what I understood. Every day I took in more information, from the minds of orderlies and nurses, and soon I could recite books and plays by heart, never having read them. I gained the ability to create whole scenes in others’ minds, make them believe they were somewhere else entirely. I frightened them; I soothed them; I made them love me or hate me - all the while, they saw what I wanted them to see, and interacted with it as if it was truly there. I became friends with many of our colleagues.
Trudy started spending more time with me. She came to see me when we weren’t meant to work together, and just the sight of her would make me smile. I started to recognize her beauty on the outside as equal to her mind: her dark hair and eyes haunted my dreams, and sometimes I would wake with a need I couldn’t begin to understand, except that it was quenched by touch. Thoughts of her kept me awake at night - both of her kindness to me and her colleagues, and of the scent which had started coming into the room with her. It somehow always led to her sleek jawline.
Soon, it became that every Tuesday - not that the days mattered in these halls - she would visit me and we would talk about everything: friends, colleagues, what we wanted to see together - it was always together. I loved that she always phrased it that way. One of her coworkers, Dr Pierce, had been starting arguments with her lately.
“He treats others like they belong to him,” Trudy told me. “He’s the only person in the world I would ever describe as cruel - and you know me.”
“You try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.” I smiled, leaning forward. She stared at me for a long time, returning the expression in her soft brown eyes. When she looked at me like that, I felt warmth wrap around me. This time, though, she leaned forward. She pressed her lips against mine. My heart pulsed rapidly in my chest, and despite knowing it was the worst possible decision, we caved to our primal desires. It was right. I knew it was right, because I felt closer to her in those moments than I had even in the furthest depths of her mind. I knew it was right…
So, when she neglected to show during our scheduled meeting, I worried. Unable to leave the room without a key of my own, I had no choice but to rely on information provided to me by orderlies and nurses - all of whom knew nothing of her disappearance.
Two whole weeks I waited, until finally I was led to the pod room, where I saw someone else waiting for me. I frowned upon seeing him, for I knew him from Trudy’s mind: Doctor Theodore Pierce.
“I suppose you know who I am,” he greeted me coldly.
I nodded.“Doctor Oddilair told me about you.”
“Good.” Dr Pierce smiled, but something about it made me feel uneasy. I had learned about ethics and morals from Trudy in my time here, and how Dr Pierce often neglected them. She had told me about how Pierce had pushed his subjects too far, sometimes even hurting them. I watched Pierce carefully as he sauntered to the edge of the room, his arm gesturing toward the pod. A person stood in front there - a person I knew.
“Ned?” I addressed him, but the orderly’s eyes were glued to Pierce, whose sickly smile made my insides quake. “Why is he here?”
“What do you mean?” Pierce’s gaze didn’t move from my friend. “You and Gertrude often do experiments with others present, don’t you? Why is this so strange?”
My jaw set as I looked back at the poor man who had come for the experiment - likely against his will. After a short silence, I told Pierce curtly, “I won’t hurt him.”
He raised his brow, feigning surprise, and chuckled lightly enough to disarm me. “I would never ask you to hurt someone.”
I frowned, confusion taking over as I watched him carefully. This didn’t match what I had heard of him. He paced around Ned, his blue gaze always pulling at my own.
“Today is just a test - a normal test, just like any other day. I don’t know what Dr Oddilair has been telling you about me, but goodness, I’m not a monster. I’m just here to see what you can do, that’s all. Is that alright with you, MIST?”
I shifted my weight uncomfortably. Something felt off here. Was it the way he was speaking, or the fact that now, in person, he seemed … friendly? I swallowed my previous resentment, forcing it as I watched him.
“Yes,” I finally answered.
“Good.” He nodded to Ned now as he stepped back. “Now, I want you to dissipate, and when you do, dig deep into Ned’s mind. Show him something from his childhood. Can you try that?”
I frowned. Something from his childhood? I had always had a sense of people when I dissipated, but Trudy had only recently been trying to help me access others’ memories. This was much further in the new program than I’d expected.
I took a breath and, meeting Ned’s gaze, I said, “Yes. Are you ready?”
He nodded and I disappeared, becoming one with the air around us. I travelled deep into Ned’s mind, feeling for his past. At first all I found were emotions, but soon they became clearer with pictures and sounds and the ghostly essence of touch. It was as if his childhood was mine. I saw his family, his school, the day he decided he wanted to go into medicine … the day he first met a powered person. The day he watched his girlfriend die.
Someone screamed. The world around me flashed white as I found myself in the pod room again, sitting back in my body and looking up at Ned, whose hands clutched his head as he dropped to his knees.
“Ned?” I felt my heart beating in my temples. “What happened?”
“That’s enough for today,” Dr Pierce announced. As I turned to face him, two security staff came from outside and grabbed my arms without a word. I tried to fight them, reaching for my friend, but the door closed between us, blocking Ned from view. They tossed me carelessly back into my room, closing and locking the door before I could turn to face them. What happened in there? Had he seen what I saw?
I sat down. The images were quickly vanishing from my mind like a bad dream, but I knew it must not be the same for Ned. I should never have listened to Dr Pierce. I should never have believed him. I was nothing but a child, and my ignorance had now hurt someone I cared about. I dropped my head into my hands, letting darkness cloud my vision as my shoulders began to shudder.
I sat like that for a long time. At some point the lights in my room turned off. I lay down and let myself drift off into a distant world, where nothing like what happened to Ned had ever happened at all.
I was woken by the wailing of a siren outside my door. I sat up straight and immediately caught sight of someone standing over me. My eyes shot wide open as they acclimated to the shadows - and I sighed sharply when I realised it was Trudy. Her white coat was gone, replaced by a dirty shirt and worn denim pants; her hair, normally sleek and soft, clumped in knots around her face.
“Don’t speak,” she hissed. “Just get up. We have to go. Now.”
“Go?” I repeated the word, frowning as I looked her over. “What do you mean, go? Outside?”
“Yes, outside.” She ushered me to my feet with one hand, while the other balanced her with a small black bag. “This place is a cesspool. I thought we were going to be helping people with you. I thought we were working toward a breakthrough in psychological treatments - but Ted just wanted to weaponize you the whole time.” She threw open the door, and I winced at the pulsating red light cutting through the darkness. I covered my ears against the alarm, and followed Trudy through back hallways marked Employees Only. “He wanted to brainwash you into becoming a soldier, sell our formula for profit. I fought him on it, and he tried to have me killed.” We burst through a pair of metal doors, and as they closed behind us the red lights and the screaming alarm receded. In spite of myself, I looked up to see the sea of lights above - the sky. Stars. It was night. I had only seen it in Trudy’s mind until now. 
I only realised I’d stopped when Trudy yanked me forward. “Come on!” she cried, bringing me back into the present. I followed her directions to get into the back seat, and lay down so no one would see me. From there, all I knew was the rhythm of her frantic driving, the bumps in the road, and the massive balls of gas swimming in space above, millions of miles away. Eventually her driving became more steady, the bumps became less frequent, and the rumbling of the vehicle lulled me into that far away dreamland, where Trudy and I could be anywhere at all, and the facility was a million miles away. I didn’t know how long I was asleep, but I woke to Trudy shaking my shoulder.
“MIST. Wake up. You have to see this.”
I groaned as I sat up, feeling some stiffness in my neck from laying in the back of a moving car. “What is it?”
“Just look.”
I raised my eyes to the windshield, where I saw we were moving down the side of a massive hill. My breath escaped me all at once at the view: sunlight touched the never-ending sea in a way that made it sparkle like cyan jewels. The long, black asphalt looked like a snake curving to avoid it, with the treetops on either side cutting across the horizon like an emerald border. All those nights in that facility. My dreams took me places like this all the time, yet I couldn’t think of a single time it had made me feel this way. It truly hit me now.
As my eyes met the impossible brilliance of the sun, I felt a sob in my throat.
“We’re free.”
<|endoftext|>
I can't
“I can’t!”
“You can.”
“I said I CAN’T!”
I really can’t, and I swear if she tells me I can one more time…
“And I said YOU CAN!”
Arguing wasn’t working. She wasn’t listening, and I know she won’t listen, no matter how important it is that she does. She'll think I’m making stuff up again just to delay going to sleep but this time I’m not.
If it were as simple as just wanting to watch TV a bit longer, that would be a relief. But tonight, everything was different.
If I slept tonight, there may not be a tomorrow.
Pondles
“Come on, Billy boy, hurry up let’s get home before I get soaking wet!”
But I didn’t hurry because I loved it in the rain, splashing in the puddles, feeling the cool slightly muddy water shoot up the legs of my shorts. Mum hated it because she said I make more work for her when I get my clothes dirty. I don’t know why, it’s actually the washing machine that does all the work.
“Nah,” I said. “You go ahead, I’m gonna stomp my way home.”
As if to add an exclamation mark, I jumped into the dirtiest puddle yet much to my big brother’s disgust.
“Oh well,” Anthony said with a scowl. “It’s you whose gonna be going to bed early tonight with no screen time.”
I kicked water from the pooling dirt patch at him and he ran on ahead. Good. I liked being by myself.
Across the road, I saw Bethany walking with her friend Amber. They were both in my class at school and although they were annoying girls, especially Amber, I did feel a tingle in my belly when I saw them. They were kinda cute.
I tried to be cool and walked through the puddles instead of hopping through like a little kid. I held my backpack straps up by my armpits and walked with a purpose like I had somewhere important to be. When I saw that they’d walked into Amber’s big yellow two-story house, I let my arms fall to my sides and moped my way home.
I wish I was brave enough to talk to them outside of class. Bethany especially, she lived right across the road from me. She had long dark hair that seemed super thick, even for a girl. It was really shiny too, and it fell over her pink and purple punk unicorn backpack like a mane.
My thoughts of the girl I’d been crushing on since year two fell away as I eyed up the biggest puddle I’d seen yet. Even though I was twelve, I could still see a hazardous watery filthy hole from a mile away, and I made a beeline for it.
At the edge of the puddle, which was more like a pond, I knew straight away that I had no chance of jumping over it. Not even a monster truck could jump over a pondle like this one. I had no way of telling how deep it was, I couldn’t even really remember this section of my route home even though I walked it every day, twice!
I decided if I was gonna do it, I’d go hard just like Anthony always said. “Go hard or go home.” Well, I’d do both, I’d go hard ON my way home. I laughed at myself as I pondered this dad-like joke.
I stepped back from the puddle, then stepped back again. I ended up taking about ten big steps back. Grabbing the straps of my backpack and holding on tight, I sprinted toward the pondle and at the edge of the water, I leaped long and high toward the centre.
I wish I could tell you how I landed, but I don’t even know if I did.
Things aren't always as they seem
As I jumped, I closed my eyes tight. It wasn’t that I was scared, I was just unsure of how much water would splash into my eyes. There would be hell to pay if I went home with a muddy body, and mud in my eyes. But my eyes opened quickly when I realised I hadn’t landed in water at all and when I looked down, I saw that I’d landed on thick lush grass instead.
“What the?” I gasped, looking around and realising no one would answer because the field was empty. “Where the hell am I?” I asked anyway.
All I could see was thick multi-green coloured long grass, tiny daisy flowers, and blue sky; it was like a picture out of a baby book. I’d kind of expected the grass to be blowing in the breeze, but there was no breeze. In fact, the air was so still it was hard to breathe, it felt like I had a pillow over my mouth and nose. I started to panic.
“ANTHONY!” I screamed at the top of my voice. “BETHANY!” I yelled, immediately regretting it in case she was there and thought I was being an idiot.
But there was no answer. In fact, my voice sounded like it didn’t go anywhere. Not muffled, but just… flat. Not loud, not as loud as it should have been, and it didn’t carry either. It just went nowhere.
I reached down to the grass and touched it, wanting to feel something real. It felt warm, but hard and sharp, like one of those miniature cactus plants they sell for $5 in the garden centre.
I pulled my hand back away from the grass and noticed small dots of blood on the palm of my hand and fingers. The grass had made me bleed! What in the shit was going on here?
“Things aren’t always as they seem.”
I turned to see that the person behind the voice was my Grandad. But that couldn’t be right, he had died ages ago, right back when I first started school.
Grandad was looking at me intensely, with light blue eyes that had seen so much and shimmered with moisture, but were still sharp and eager.
“Things aren’t always as they seem,” he said again, and as he did his body seemed to melt and fade into transparency before re-forming into a younger, fitter, stronger looking body. A body I recognised; with eyes I looked at every day in the mirror. But older, almost as old as mum was now but not quite. I knew, or at least I was as sure as I could be in this strange world, it was me.
Just breathe
The ‘me guy’ seemed to shimmer in this otherwise flat space. He was the only thing that had substance, even though he was the most unreal thing I’d ever seen. Why was I seeing an old me in this weird place that I somehow landed in? I was going mental for sure.
“You’re not going mental,” the ‘me guy’ said, and my jaw dropped even further.
He tilted his head back and laughed.
“Quite the opposite. Your mind is expanding, not distorting. This is the start of a phenomenal future for you, and for the rest of the world.”
He laughed again at my confused expression, then his shoulders relaxed and he looked at me through my own dark brown eyes and frowned.
“I know this is blowing your mind right now, but we had to get your attention and I think we’ve got it, right?”
Then his voice boomed as his body changed again: “DO WE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?”
This time, the ‘me guy’ warped, bent, and twisted into various shapes before settling into one, all the while making a screeching sound like fingernails on a blackboard. Its neck began to grow. It stretched much higher than me, and as it reached its limit and pinged back down it became a snake with bright yellow eyes. Then the eyes turned into flames, and I could feel the heat burning my own eyes. I thought my face was going to melt right off.
I covered my eyes with my hands because I was terrified now. I didn’t want to see what he would become. I didn’t want to be here anymore at all!
Silence came first, then the sense of complete loneliness. I felt hollow. I had been taken to the limits of my fear tolerance and now felt like a limp, unimportant rag doll, held up by something other than my own will. I stopped breathing for the longest time, then, before my lungs jolted back into action, I took a long slow breath in and opened my eyes.
Standing in front of me, smiling softly and wearing her favourite long black dress and boots was my mother. I had to stop myself from running toward her and throwing my arms around her begging to be taken away from this place. Because I knew it wasn’t really her. This ‘mum’ could change into anything in an instant. I couldn’t trust her. But I knew I had to.
“I know you’ve been through a lot since we brought you here,” she said, in the same soft caring voice I’ve been listening to ever since I was born. “You're overwhelmed with confusion, fear, and desperation, but I need you to listen to me. WE need you to listen. We will only have one chance.”
“One chance for what?” I asked.
“One chance to bring forth the sun, and the survival of mankind.”
Where there is life
“Before there was life on earth, there was darkness,” she began. “The planets and the star you know as the sun existed, but no light or heat emanated from it… until we came.”
My ‘mother’ continued with a story so ridiculously unbelievable that it could have come from one of my comic books, or some retro episode of The Outer Limits.
She told me of another world, much larger than the one I had been born into. A world where physical beings didn’t exist, where entities traveled through the darkness interacting with each other, forming with one another, and multiplying. I was mesmerised. While it sounded like fiction, I believed every word, I KNEW it to be true. In fact, it was like I knew it already and was simply being reminded.
“All at once, we gathered together on the sun and our force created a spark which gave the star light.”
A look of what I can only describe as fear came over my ‘mother’s’ face, and she continued. “Then the light became a flame, and the flame a heaving inferno of heat given strength by our essence.” She fell silent.
“Umm,” I stammered. “You created the sun?”
“No. The sun had already been created. We just gave it… force. But that force has been fading for millennia. The life that we gave the sun, has been spread throughout the galaxy and it is not renewable, it is not infinite. It gives so much, but it does not receive. It is life, therefore it will experience death.”
My eyes widened as I started to understand where this story was going. Then, the being that presented as my mother, reached out and touched my face with her hand and I felt her lifeforce and finally understood.
The truth and the warning
I know I was still in the strange place and I could feel her presence. But I couldn’t move or speak. Her hand was a conduit, and through it came the truth and the warning, in a rush of realisation that took my breath away.
She took me deep into my own body, through arteries that carried blood to my vital organs, through the synapses of my brain that sparked and shifted, and pushed me beyond my physical self. If I could describe the feeling, I could only say that it felt as if my body was being turned inside out, and as dizzying as that sounds, everything became clear as she continued to show me why I had been brought here.
When it was over, and her hand left my face, my eyes and mind readjusted to the strange place and while I was struggling to focus, I could tell I was now alone.
The exhaustion fell over me like a weighted blanket. I took my jacket off, laid it on the ground, and sat cross-legged with my head in my hands. There was no doubt anymore, no confusion or uncertainty about why I was here. It was simple. Too simple. And I knew what I had to do.
You know what to do
When I had woken, cold and wet on the last day of Spring, I was lying on the damp grass of our neighbour, Mr Chancey’s super tidy lawn. My head hurt and I immediately thought I’d slipped and hit it on the concrete underneath the giant puddle I’d jumped in. But then I remembered the strange place: my granddad, my brother, my mother, and the warning I’d been given. I panicked then and had to pinch my arm to force myself to breathe slowly and regain control. I knew it hadn’t been a dream or one of the dramatic imaginings that I’d often have on my way home from school. It was the truth, and it had been a warning.
The presence in the shape of my mother had told me that we would have one more summer. Not my family and I, but the planet. The whole entire planet.
The sun had just one more summer to give before its force faded and earth cooled to a standstill. I had been shown that on the last day of summer, I would wake up expecting to see shafts of light around my bedroom blind, but all I would see is darkness. And all I would feel was the cold.
I’d asked the presence what I could do to prevent it. Did it want me to save the planet? Why was it telling me these things? Was there something I could do?
“You know what to do,” it said. “You all do.”
And in that moment, I did. And when I woke, I remembered. And from that day until now, I have done it. It’s simple. I knew it already, we all do.
Something changed in the world from the moment I woke on that lawn. It wasn’t just me, it was my friends, our neighbours, Bethany, even her bitchy friend. We all changed. People became… kinder, less greedy, more caring, more thoughtful, happier.
Strangers shared meaningful looks with each other and nods of understanding without speaking a word. It was like everyone knew what was at stake.
The teachers at school actually took time to talk to me, one-on-one, and help me with maths which was my shittiest subject.
Mr Chancey even started a lawnmowing business, and every house in the street was landscaped like something out of a Home and Garden magazine. It was surreal.
Bethany started to walk home with me after school, we even did homework together one night! And my brother hung out with me more, even playing catch after school instead of mooching around with his friends.
News reports from around the world didn’t talk about war, famine, crime, and murder. Instead, smiling reporters standing in the sunshine, covered urgent new methods of environmental protection the likes of which had never been seen before, people were opening their doors to their communities and wildlife welfare became as important as technological advancements.
Everything seemed brighter, and it wasn’t just that it was summer, it was that things were actually better. So much better. Almost as if people were living like it was the last summer of their lives…
“You know what to do.”
Look east
I did know what to do, and everyone else did too. I know they’d been given the same truth and warning as I had. Maybe in a different way, but they had. They must have for things to have changed so rapidly.
But today had been the last day of summer. And now it was time for bed.
I didn’t want to go to bed. I didn’t want to go to sleep. I didn’t want to wake up to darkness in the cold. I didn’t want this to be the end. But I wasn’t sure if we’d done enough.
I decided to pretend to sleep until everyone else had gone to bed, and then wait for the relaxed slow breathing and gentle snoring of my mother. She was always the last one to sleep.
“I won’t sleep,” I whispered quietly to myself. “It’s my decision, and I won’t do it.”
I listened for ages, but I didn’t hear her sleeping. I didn’t hear anything. It was eerily quiet in our house.
I crept quietly out of my bedroom and down the hall to the lounge. I was startled when I saw the shape of a person outside the big glass doors. Then I realised who it was.
“Mum?” I said quietly as I tiptoed across the deck to where she was sitting.
She turned and looked at me and I could see she was about to tell me to go back to bed, but instead, she patted the seat next to her.
I sat down and she put her arm around my shoulders.
“I won’t go to sleep,” I murmered.
“I know, my love,” mum said softly.
“Can I wait here with you, mum?”
“Yes,” she said, squeezing me tighter. “You can wait here with all of us.”
It was then that I looked around and saw that we weren’t alone. Not really.
Next door, Mr Chancey was sitting in a love seat on his porch clutching his wife’s hand. Bethany was across the road sitting on a blanket with her little brother’s head resting in her lap. Then Anthony and dad came out of the kitchen door behind me. They didn’t say anything. They just sat quietly with the rest of us, looking east. Waiting.
<|endoftext|>
Submerged beneath an icy depth, head in an oak whisky barrel, he rose and flicked back his hair and looked to the sky. Fresh. Under the candour of stars.
Have the constellations of this Terra-System been named, he wondered.
A towel provided imbalance to his nude. Best to wash after travelling. Washes away fatigue. He picked up his white linens and pulled over his shirt and worked into a pair of loose-fitting trousers.
His journal awaited his entry, resting on a wooden crate with the typographic: 3466e.
Terra-system 0’s current fixture in time.
He picked out the pen from its leather thong that bound the covers and opened to a blank page and started noting:
No locals spotted.
No signs of Colt, either.
He looked at the fire. Troglodytic. Twigs and sticks and leaves. Simple.
Maybe not for this system, he thought. A new revelation.
Colt couldn’t have strayed far; the terrain was flat, resembling Terra-system 0’s Arizonan desert, parched. Colt’s arrival was just shy of twelve hours ago. He was asked to report to me after finding the locals. But nothing so far, he noted. Now it was his duty to track down his missing partner, and doing so, fulfil their mission.
He stomped his steel-clad boots on the dry dirt floor.
Below me. No other place for them to hide.
The moons. There were two. Each as big and white and pearly.
To reify his appreciation of the sight, he sketched a simple piece into his journal.
A memoir. Flicking through his dozens of sketches, each denoting a system he was now familiar with, a system untouched by graceful civilisation, until the flicker of the flame.
He had been on this system for four hours. The moons didn’t falter from their heights. Perhaps this system has a longer night cycle, he thought. Had Colt really come here? Odd. He opened the crate and lifted out his wristwatch, a bulk piece metal with an intricate circuit system hidden behind a screen.
He turned the dials and watched the different Terra-systems flick past him in holographic display.
It was definitely the right system, he noted.
Terra-system 16c. No. Terra-system 9. That was next. Terra-system 14. That’s it.
Scrolling through nuances of information:
Anthropological similarities to Homo Sapiens of Terra-system 0… Detrimental sociological development… evolutionary standpoint has surpassed Homo Erectus in accordance to Terra-system 0’s frame of time… most advanced tribe are comparable to Homo Floresiensis… still with initiative, they lack an ability to produce fire… located in cave systems, accustomed to darkness… rise to surface in order to hunt and feed… capable of violence… provide Terra-system 14 with light…
Rotation around its sun: N/A…
He sat by his fire and began warming a brew.
Colt would be safe, he convinced himself. His training made him over-qualified for primordial territory like this. Worse came to worst, Colt’s watches transmission had been jammed and he’d already logged off this system. Wishful thinking.
Shattered. The harping wind frayed his nerves. The thought of descending knotted his stomach.
Rest. Briefly. Travel had grinded him to smut.
It had been successful, if not for the minor fright it caused Peck.
She stirred and brushed up the dirt with a hoof, her head turning to his pockets where he withdrew a lump of sugar and fed her one. She scrutinised him with her black equine eyes.
“We’ll find him,” he said as she nuzzled up to him, “then we’ll be onto the next system.”
He caught his own reflection in the glaze of her eyes.
Salt white, he made out, even through the dark looking glass.
Travel by Tempus was the only tribulation of such a fulfilling occupation.
He looked to the carriage that Peck was bound to. Draped in black curtain like a magician’s prop for his prestige. Beneath its cover was a – still experimental – contraption of peak human excellence. It was his way of travel. As an itinerant salesman, his only goods being the spark to a prolific, soon-to-be modernistic society, given the hundreds of thousands of years that would follow. And the cost for such society? Nothing. His product to sell – give away – was fire and the ability to use it. Give an evolutionary push to beings that required one.
Each system displayed gratitude differently. Some gifting intricately hand-crafted ornaments. Others pronounced him as a God, if they even knew what that was. Some systems caught onto the fires capabilities early. Others shied in fear. Focussing on its dangers. Some disregarded his gift completely. Subservient to darkness.
There was no better way to flip-off the evolutionary scale than denying the existence of one of Terran’s greatest discoveries.
To them, he’d proclaim a system unworthy to thrive. One meant to dwell in the shadows and never break towards light.
The moons remained. He had placed his one-man camp besides a cave mouth, one of Colt’s last known coordinates. He hoped to catch a cave inhabitant on their way to a hunting rally. None showed. Strange, he thought. No animals crossed his path. Neither did Colt.
Experience taught approaching tribes on the surface. Plenty of space to run, if it ever came to it. Travel in Tempus was confined enough. He looked into the black gash on the rockface. Damp walls and dark crevices were inevitable
A whinny sounded from afar. He traced the sound. Distinct. It was Trigger, Colt’s mare. She bounded over the plains, her fur catching the moonlight, candescent in the humid air. He waved Trigger down. Frightened. She pulled a load. Colt’s Tempus. He calmed her by pressing his face against hers and feeding her a sugar cube. She caught sight of the cave entrance. Bucking. He fell back. Colt definitely went inside. Clearly, he hasn’t come out.
I can no longer delay this, he told himself. “You’ll be alright,” he said to Peck and Trigger. He lifted up the hem of the cloak and rerouted his Tempus to a familiar Terra-system. A safe one, if anything were to go wrong and a swift escape was the only option. Before that came his hand gun – The Equalizer. Rigged with a plasma ionization core that turned the tide in favour to those that held the weapon. Never equal, only fair. If it meant he won.
He dropped the cloak back over Tempus and dialled in several numbers on his watch.
Tempus vanished. No one will hide my machine, he thought, Terra-system 0’s fiction was a doozy.
The mares remained by the fire, tied to a post that was hammered into the dirt.
He slung a back-pack over his shoulder.
“I’ll be back soon.” He didn’t question their safety. His concern wasn’t up here. It was below.
There was an interminable silence, other than the drips of condensation that followed him, until he came upon a smoothed-out platform, a centrepiece roofed under stalactites, and heard a sound uncanny to a voice. His watch casted it’s aura of light and he languished at the unseen. I have come here with purpose, he reaffirmed. This species was inept, he thought. Yet still he tightened his grip on The Equalizer.
I am a deity of peace, perhaps it would be sound to act like one, he questioned. Maybe Colt had crossed a traditional sacrilege of the locals and offended their sanction.
The holster rested on his right hip. If the ball dropped, it was a snatch away. 
He followed the noise, calculating the direction which it originated.
Several paces later, the light caught etchings on a flat wall. They were drawings. Similar to those found in Terra-system 0, marked in prehistoric ages. Drawn with such care, deft scratchings of what, he asked himself. And how? In darkness, felt with their fingers, each engraving a guiding path? He switched to a photographic setting on his watch and snapped a picture of the art. A sign of intelligence, awareness, he reflected.
Following the arbitrary panoply of etches, he sourced them to the centre of the wall where they unfolded around the largest drawing.
A God. A hierarchy of some sort. Something worm-like, long, tapering in a coil. He looked South, the only direction the tunnel led. It widened. On the floor, an object. His jaw clenched; stomach flipped. A watch, like his own, like Colt’s. Discarded beneath a rocky alcove. Hidden. A green light flashed. He stooped and picked it up. A pre-recorded message.
He played it and listened, hanging onto every sentence, dreading each long pause and agonizing at the sound of Colt’s voice which undulated through octaves. He was speaking through pain:
The locals… they’re somewhat humanlike, primitive…
He checked the details of the message as it played. Less than an hour ago. Colt was trained, he told himself again. Whatever happened, he’d be fine. The message continued, he walked further, encapsuled by the watches light.
I saw a ritual – something like that…
His breathing was jagged, his pauses long. Had he been running, he wondered. His pace quickened and the tunnel widened. He crouched and shuffled beneath an overhanging rock, standing up on the other side, facing an open space. The walls around him were a chalk white, stabbed at by tools to create an art piece like something out of his sketch book. Everywhere he turned, drawings. A recurring image; something long, weaving in-between the fixed people.
They sacrificed one of their own. Their blood used as a libation. They’re ruled by something…
He perspired, trying to convince himself it was from his swift movements, not the anxiety that abounded each thought. Was it worth shouting Colt’s name, he wondered. To disturb the silence felt wrong. As if these hollow tunnels weren’t mean to be spoken in.
There’s something else in the caves. They live in darkness for a reason...
He twisted a dial on his watch and the light intensified. It was a cavern. Vast. Shadows pushed away, revealing the ribbed walls, and among them, hidden in a cluster of near thirty, people.
Don’t give them fire - it attracts it….
A groaning sounded from behind. Like stones rubbed together.
The image of the people were branded stills in his mind. Their eyes forlorn.
Did they even need fire, he asked himself. Fire – light, attracts it.
He turned. In that moment, he knew that Colt was gone. The message would be the last he’d ever hear of him. For himself, what would he amount to? Another scratching on the wall, he thought, the stranger with the odd bracelet, if they were to ever see it. But how could they?
Not without fire.
He would have appreciated the darkness in those final seconds.
The black, like the surface above, nothing to see. Nothing to fret.
Nothing to relay the uncoiling deity before him.
<|endoftext|>
The warm glow from the fiber-place filled the large room. Since the abolishment of fossil fuels, many innovations were necessary. This appliance had glowing fibers dancing in an updraft to create the illusion of fire. It didn’t warm the air, but kindled the heart.
The family sat facing the fiber-place. But each stared at the device glowing in their hands. Depending on its use they were called torches, or smarphs. A cool glow lit their masked faces.
No one spoke. The sound of snapping of fibers and the humming fan filled the room. Fingers danced over mini-keyboards as each communicated with distant friends. These friends, perhaps known for years, had rarely been met in person. All stayed safely within subterranean living quarters throughout the world.
A multitude of factors made it unsafe to venture outside. They were told the sun’s radiation, poor air quality and the lingering pandemic were toxic.
Modern technology connected people despite their inability to meet in person.
Skittle’s father, Gramps, sat in his dim corner reading a book lit by a small lamp clipped onto the book itself. His intermittent chuckles punctuated the silence. Random guffaws sent light bouncing around the room.
Drone, Skittle’s husband, believed Gramps had become senile. And, maybe worse, was terminally behind the times. Drone knew books were archaic and wasteful. They were ‘dust collectors’ and ‘bug huts.’
‘Imagine reading a book when more efficient info transfer is available.’
He tolerated Gramps, for Skittle. Gramps caused little trouble and, except for his books, took little space. Drone ignored him, often forgetting he existed at all. Until he laughed and waved that crazy light around. Or started his mythical ‘good old days’ rant.
Their home had no windows. They never worried about sunlight, nor dangerous radiation, seeping in. The torch function of smarphs fulfilled their lighting needs. Global warming made candles obsolete. Their daughter, Feather, had never seen one.
Clock time ruled. Drone had removed electric clocks for being wasteful. Their incessant ticking annoyed him.
Skittle asked Drone, “Dee, what’s the time?”    
Drone checked his smarph. “Almost one.”
She leaped up. “It’s late! No wonder I’m hungry.” She moved into the kitchen. “Any requests?”
Feather set down her smarph and followed. “How can I help, Mom?”
They prepared a snack and called the men in. The four made sandwiches buffet-style and returned to their spots near the fiber-place.
Gramps liked socializing. He could share memories about times past. He gestured with his sandwich as he talked.
“When I was young, we’d have barbecues in the yard, or the park. We’d sit at a picnic table and feast on juicy meat, corn on the cob, watermelon, potato salad… everything! We’d run around, kick a ball, or play catch. It was paradise.”
Drone mumbled. “Pure fantasy…” Skittle gave him a look. “So Gramps… We should thank you for climate change? All your open fires and smoke?”
Gramps smiled. His son-in-law needed new material. “Yes Drone. Put that on my head stone. I had so much fun, it was well worth it.”
“Except it didn’t happen. It’s always been like this.”
Gramps scoffed. “Kids, these days…”
Drone addressed Feather. “When I went to Burrows high, we traveled everywhere in Vaccity by tunnel. No one went outside if they could help it.” He looked around for support. “And, I’ll have you know, I’m not a kid. I’m the grown up. I pay the bills in this house.”
Gramps laughed and slapped his thigh for emphasis. “Oh my, Drone, you tell a good one…”
Drone said, “I remember when Governor Gnusome covered the river. Everyone loved it. It’d been dry for years.”
Gramps nodded. “True…”
“Then he changed his name to Knowsall. What a genius. Covering it saved commuters from ever going outside. He only made its use mandatory because people didn’t know what was good for them.”
Gramps interjected, “They included escape hatches in case of flooding.”
Drone nodded. “Trams made it easy. No exposure to the elements. What an innovation. Made himself governor in a landslide. It was expensive, but he created so many jobs. He truly is the twilight of the world.”
Cole came in. He was Feather’s older brother, fifteen, going on three.
Drone gave him a hard look. “Where’s your mask? Always wear your mask. You know that.”
He looked at his family. “You’re not wearing masks.”
“We’re eating.”
“Give me some food then, so I can breathe, without a lecture.”
Drone rolled his eyes. Skittle got up and prepared Cole a plate.
“You know, Cole, wearing masks offers many benefits. One is, they’re safe.”
“Uh huh…”
“For instance, I’ve never seen your mother’s face. And we’re still together. Never got sick. Thanks to masks.”
Skittle called from the kitchen. “Stop being silly, Dee.”
“Anyway, I was telling Feather about our fearless governor. Knowsall. He married us after the virtual, virtue gathering. A hundred thousand weddings at once. Online, of course.”
Skittle said, “So magical…”
“Awesome…” Feather loved these stories.
Drone continued. “I’ll never forget Governor Knowsall saying, ‘I now pronounce you person and person…’ We shared the sweetest fist bump ever. Didn’t we, Skit?”
She dabbed her eyes. Tucking her handkerchief away, she asked, “Everyone done eating?”
Everyone nodded and pulled their masks on.
Drone addressed Cole. “So, kiddo, haven’t seen you today. Where you been?”
“Mooch, Maisy and I went to the beach.”
“Not in the water though.”
“Yeah, we went swimming.”
He couldn’t comprehend. “You went to the beach!? Trying to kill yourself? How many times…?”
“Relax, Dad. You taught me to swim in those tunnels under the city. When I was little. Remember?”
“Cole… Swimming the sweres is one thing. But the beach has pollution and nasty creatures… And tsunamis.”
“It was amazing. Flocks of birds flew…”
“As I said, disease ridden creatures…”
Feather glanced at her mother with a sad face. Skittle patted her head.
Drone said, “At least you wore a mask, right?”
“Not to swim, Dad. I need to breathe.”
“But the air, Cole. It’s poisonous.”
“It’s clean. No one around. Nice breeze.” Cole imagined the moment. “Could see forever.”
“You went in daylight?”
“We had fun. It was great.”
Gramps laughed.
“Fun? I tell you things so you can survive. But you don’t listen… All about fun.”
Smiling, Cole gave Gramps a thumbs up. “Gramps inspired me. He showed us ‘Beach Blanket…’”
“Oh my god! Not Beach Blanket Bingo!” He turned on Gramps. “I can’t believe you. Teaching your grandson to gamble? It got banned for decadence. Half naked people running around…”
Gramps held his head up. “I showed him ‘Gidget’ too.”
“Watch your language, Gramps. There are children here. Talk like that with friends, but not in my house.”
Cole and Gramps looked at each other and shrugged.
“I’ve told you a thousand times, ‘stay out of the sun.’ How can I stress it’ll make you sick? That’s what torches are for… and tunnels. I don’t expose myself to deadly radiation.”
“Grope.”
Drone got in Cole’s face. “What’d you say?”
Cole stepped back. “Look at us, Dad.”
Drone shrugged. “What?”
“We grope around in the dark. Stare at our smarphs all day. Do you look in a mirror? Ever? You can’t, ‘cause you’re blind.”
“I see your disrespect. Don’t need the sun for that. I see the fool I’ve raised.”
Skittle tried to intervene. “Please, Drone. Don’t…”
Cole stepped forward. “You’ve never seen me.”
Shaking his head, “Don’t use up your sympathy credits, Cole. Just don’t.”
“Turn off your smarph. What do you see?”
One by one, all but Drone turned their smarphs off. The gloom deepened. Cole flipped off the fiber-place. The fan wound down. Only Drone’s smarph emitted light. He set it to torch mode and aimed it at everyone in the room.
His laugh sounded forced. “I see you!”
Cole opened the exterior door. Sunlight flooded the room. Everyone squinted. In a few moments, they lowered their hands and smiled behind their masks. Drone’s torch could not compete.
Skittle picked up a paper from the floor. “Thought I’d lost that.”
“No place to hide, out here.” Cole stepped into the light and stretched.
Blinking, Feather moved to the doorway. Shielding her eyes, she looked to the distance. “I see trees. Are those birds?”
A distant flock wheeled about before settling into the tree tops. Mountains filled the horizon. There were no loud sounds, but so much to hear.
“It’s so beautiful. How have I never seen this?”
Skittle touched Feather’s shoulder. “Is it safe? Maybe…” A gentle breeze ruffled her hair. She shut her eyes, pulled down her mask, and breathed deeply. “Do I smell flowers?”
Cole threw his mask away and shouted. Laughing, he jumped and spun about. Feather joined the celebration.
“Stop it, kids. What will the neighbors think?”
Feather took her mother’s hand. “No one cares, Mom. They’re all staring at smarphs.”
Skittle joined hands with her children. They solemnly skipped in a circle and, gaining speed, began to laugh.
With a huge grin, Gramps watched from the doorway.
In his raspy voice, he sang an old rock ‘n roll anthem. “I’m free. I am free…”

Lisa Danbury looked over the dark town from her apartment’s tiny balcony. The light from the sun and moon had been lost to earth years before she had been born. Since the Government had forced everyone to use solar power a year before the sun faded, power plants and factories had only lasted for a year or two after. She had heard stories about people being killed over things that made artificial light until that was gone too. She had seen flashlights when she had been small but as with the sun and candles the batteries for the batteries died. Car batteries also died at some point and without working plants and factories to make more they were lost to them as well.
Lisa had never seen a working TV or heard a radio play and only seen the moon, sun, and stars in pictures. She’d only read about storms and living plants. When space had died the seasons and weather had died too. She’d never felt the rain or smelled flowers. Lisa had read articles about humans living in space before, so she couldn’t understand why they had no idea what had happened to make the earth and space turn pitch black.
When she had turned ten, she had wanted to study the subject more, but her father had been afraid it would be seen as a challenge to the Government, and they would take her away as they had done many times over the last twenty plus years when anyone decided to investigate too closely. Her mother on the other hand thought her daughter learning about the space she’d seen at her age and finding the answer to their problem had been brilliant, she’d snuck books and maps out of the library before it had been shut down. Ten years had gone by since she’d began, and Lisa still didn’t have an answer.
“Maybe there isn’t an answer. Maybe I’m just a foolish girl on a fool’s errand.”
Nobody had talked about the sun or moon in so long it was as if they had never existed. Lisa wondered from time to time if they were just stories. What in the world? She thought she had seen some type of light in the sky. It was just a long sliver of light and only for a second or two, but she was certain it had been there. She stared hard at the sky for a long time before walking back into her home.
The next morning was colder than normal, and she shivered as her bare feet touched the wood floor. She knew from her studies the sun had warmed the earth even in cold months. She didn’t understand then how the earth still got colder and warmer if there was no sun. It never actually got warm, but it wasn’t as cold sometimes than others. She dressed in blue jeans and a black sweater. After throwing her hair in a ponytail and pulling on a jacket Lisa put some books into her backpack, put her fireplace out, and headed out the door. Her eyes adjusted quickly as she stepped from the building. She thought they were adjusting quicker the older she got and that scared her, humans weren’t meant to be able to see clearly in the dark. Lisa hunched her shoulders as she walked into cold. It felt odd in a way she couldn’t articulate. She had never felt the wind, yet she was positive on a cellular level that that is what she should be feeling along with the biting cold.
Lisa walked faster, she was late to meet her close friend Eli Morgan, as she did almost every day. Eli had been a twenty-five-year-old scientist when space vanished, now he studied and experimented in the privacy of his family’s old mansion. She rounded the corner of Maple and fifth when she heard the people talking.
“A sliver of light in the sky. I tell ya, I seen it with my own eyes.” A tall man with a beard said excitedly.
Lisa joined the group to listen in.
“You did not.”
“Don’t let Protectors hear you say that. They took off Jimmy Hood for saying such things two months ago.”
The Protectors were a group of individuals who were called up by the Government to protect the people but really, they just took people who spoke out against the Government or said something the Government deemed mutiny. Talk of lights in the sky would get you taken for sure, since it caused excitement. 
“What time did you see it?” Lisa asked in a whisper.
“Two am.” The man answered in a lower tone than before.
She stared up at the man for a moment before turning around her timekeeper, a small clock type object the officials had sent out just after the electricity had stopped, had read two a.m. when she’d seen it too. Lisa was about to cross the street when a Protection cargo wagon with three large black horses pulling it pulled up. Her heart sank as bile rose in her throat. The books she had were banned, if they looked in her bag, they’d take her. She took a deep breath as two very large men walked up to her and smiled before carrying on their way. She sighed with relief and walked away as normal as she could. She hear the man’s cries for help as they arrested him. Lisa frowned, she wanted to help the man, but she thought the only to do that was to save them all and find the truth.
“Eli? Are you up?” Lisa had let herself into his larger home. She made her way to the kitchen where a pot of water was boiling over the fire and a pan of meat was burning next to it. Lisa shook her head and moved the pan off the rack. “Eli?”
“Down here,” his deep voice rose through the floor. “I think I have something.”
Lisa wound her way around and down into the basement. It was lite up with old oil fueled torches placed around the stairwell and large open space that made up the basement. Eli was lucky his family had always kept things, the torches had come in handy, and their storage of oil was a huge pit in the basement that a crazy uncle had filled with oil a hundred years ago because someone said it couldn’t be done and someone had just covered it instead of draining it.  
“A man was taken for talking about a light. But Eli, I seen it too.”
“It wasn’t just a light. It was a crack.”
“A crack?”
Eli turned and stared at her. “Did I studder?”
She shook her head, “don’t get snippy. I just don’t understand how the sky could crack.”
“Because it’s not the sky, Lisa, I believe it’s a dome.” He said with a stern expression.
“Dome?” She asked sitting down, “what do you mean?”
Eli stood and paced, “they put a dome over us. Everything they said died are still out there! Nothing died! We’ve been put in a fishbowl of sorts.”
“Eli, that’s crazy.”
He said nothing as he walked up the spiral staircase. Lisa shrugged and followed him. He led her up to the attic where his telescope set in a hidden window. Eli opened the curtain and pointed at the telescope. She walked up and looked into the view finder. A blank nothingness stared back like always.
“So, what am I looking at.”
Eli messed with some knobs while Lisa continued to stare into the blackness. “You see it. That odd line.”
“Yes,” Lisa looked for several minutes, her mouth agape, before moving away. “Skies don’t have seams.”
Eli nodded, “Exactly.”
He dropped the curtain back into place and stalked back to the basement Lisa was close on his heals. They walked quickly staying silent until they were in the basement. Eli went to work writing on a white board while Lisa worked to find anything about seams and the sky in her books.
“I saw the sun last night, Lisa.” Eli turned hope filled his voice.
“I believe you. So would the Government. I think that is why they took that man today, they are worried. But why would they open the dome. Wait, better question, why are we in a dome to begin with?”
“They don’t want us to know the sun is still out there for some reason.” Eli wrote EXPERIMENT: WHY????? on the board. “We are an experiment, Lis. I don’t know why but it makes sense and answers why we could never find a true scientific answer for where the light went.”
Lisa threw the book she was holding across the room, “What could possibly be gained by all this?”
Eli shrugged. “I do not know, but we are going to find out.”
They worked to find answers on a biological science level instead of a space one for hours until their stomach’s growls for food couldn’t be ignored. The duo worked in the kitchen to make lunch just as well as they did in the basement. Eli was quiet most of the time only giving her a grunt here and there. Lisa sighed and gave up talking she had known him long enough to know when he got like that there was nothing that would snap him out of it until he got the answer he wanted.
“Oh my gosh!”
Lisa stood so fast her bowl tipped over. She ran down to the basement steps leaving a very confused Eli with a mouth full of food to stare after her. After he picked up the mess, he ventured down himself. Lisa was sitting in the middle of the room surrounded by maps, books, and equations on pieces of paper. He stared down at her still confused. She made an “oh” sound and turned the book in her lap toward him.
“The Simpsons?” Eli picked up the book. “It was an adult cartoon.”
“I know that, but they were put under a dome too. What if that is what happened to us? What if we have or had a disease? I read how many people thought the writers of the show were predicting the future.”
“It was just a show though, Lisa, there was no truth to it. They just wrote things people talked about.”
Her face grew grim, “Eli, what if there was? I mean a lot of things they said in the nineteen-nineties ended up happening in the early two-thousands.”
Eli moved some of the books and knelt in front of her. “Lisa,” he took a map from her lap and took her hands in his larger ones, “Those were just things that happened after years and years of people saying they should or couldn’t ever happen. There is no truth to it, I promise.”
“Okay.”
Eli stood. “We need to go to the capital.”
It was Lisa’s turn to stare at him as he told her of his plan to travel to the capital and spy on the Government and to find out why they were under a dome. They decided to leave after the excitement of the light time to die down so The Protectors wouldn’t think anything of them leaving the city. Lisa went home a few hours later her backpack almost empty. Her books about space stayed in Eli’s basement since they were now useless.
TWO DAYS LATER
They had told anyone who would ask that they were just going to the mountains for a few days. They all bought it, Lisa figured it was because they all though she and Eli were a couple and she didn’t mind letting them think what they wanted, it hid the truth and that was all either of them cared about.
Eli showed up at her door ten-to-eight in morning. “Ready?”
“Yep.” She donned her heavy travel pack and walked out her door.
Lisa looked up at the building that had been home for six years and hoped the next time she seen it there would be sunlight or moonlight shining down on it. Their plan was basic: look, listen, learn. Easy in theory, terrifying in reality, but it was the only way.
They’d traveled for a week before reaching the capital. Lisa looked around. It was not what she’d heard it looked like from others. There was electricity and living trees and plants. Everyone who’d been there that she’d spoken to had said it was a dead zone just like Darkfalls.
Lisa looked up hoping to see lights in the sky, but it was still the dome. She looked around while Eli found a hiding spot that would allow them to see the city but not be seen. It was an old camp site behind the tree line on the out skirts of the town. 
He woke her in a frenzy the next day. “Look!”
Lisa looked up with sleep filled eyes. The dome was opening. The sky greeted them. She stood up and tilted her face up. The moon shone so bright she could see everything around them clearly and the stars shimmered they seemed to be blinking and twinkling. Amazing was the only word that she could think of to describe what she seen. Book descriptions and pictures couldn’t do it justice.
“I’ve missed this sight the most I think.”
Lisa stood close to him. “We need to get this back. I can’t go home to total darkness knowing this is above us.”
“I agree.”
They watched the sky for at least four hours before the dome slid close again. Lisa thought for a moment then asked, “why do they open it?”
“Fresh air, I’d imagine.”
It made sense she guessed.
The next night they seen a SUV in front of a large building. “So, they get gas from somewhere too.” It started to drive away. “Let’s go.”
They followed it to a fenced in area with a large wheel and levers.
“I have been all over Darkfalls and have never seen this.” Lisa started making notes and drew the levers and wheel and how they needed to turn, push, or pull each one.
They were too excited to sleep, Lisa decided they should just start for home. They walked quickly for the rest of the night and on into the next day until Lisa couldn’t carry her pack. The duo stopped and hid for a few hours before going again. They made it back to Darkfalls in just a few days only stopping now and then to rest. Since Eli’s home was closer Lisa decided to stay there. 
Lisa woke a full day later to the smell of fresh coffee, well as fresh as the Government allowed them to have. She still couldn’t believe they’d been so stupid as to believe them. Even as afraid as her father was, he had warned her not to trust the Government or Protection. Now she wondered if he had known something but couldn’t or wouldn’t say. She smiled as she walked into the kitchen Eli was flipping hotcakes.
“Not burning them this time, I hope.” She took her favorite seat next to the hearth.
“Not at all. I think tonight we need to go find the control center.”
Lisa yawned she was exhausted and just wanted to sleep, but knew he was right. They needed to find the controls and collect details on how many Protectors guarded the area and how hard it would be to get in. They planned and plotted until Eli’s Timekeeper said it was seven am. It was time to go. Lisa started to open the door, but a sudden loud screech caused her to stop. 
“What is that?” She asked thinking it was one of his many inventions messing up.
Eli shook his head as he covered his ears. The noise grew louder, and they realized it was coming from the outside. A man’s voice broke through the sound. “Citizens remain calm! This will be over soon. Do not attempt to fight the gas. Stay calm and remain where you are.” Soon they heard what sounded like bombs going off just outside the door. Eli grabbed her hand and ran to a small room. The door didn’t lock tight in time and the small room began filling with a bright yellow gas. They held each other close, as the gas seeped into their mouths and noses causing them to cough and grow sleepy quickly even though they tried to fight.
They woke without knowing how much time had passed. Eli and Lisa were both shocked to see they were still in the little room they’d been positive they had been found out and arrested. Eli helped her up and walked into the living room to discover light pouring into the room. It was extremely bright and painful to their sensitive eyes.
“The sun?”
Eli nodded and went to a trunk behind the sofa. He pulled out old sunglasses. “Glad I held on to these.”
They put on the glasses and walked outside. Everyone in the town were milling around in shock and some in a panic. Lisa commented on how pale they all were, and Eli informed her it was due to the lack of sunlight. The man’s voice came back, “Experiment 86825-32756377 has been compromised. You may continue your normal lives.” Weeks later they all learned the town of Darkfalls and others around it had been the subject of Experiment Total Darkness for over twenty years 
Lisa and Eli married a year later and funded Project Where Are They after discovering the people The Protection had taken hadn’t been killed or imprisoned but had been moved away from the experimental area and had their memories wiped. They never found the reason for the experiment, but they never stopped searching or spreading awareness about distrustful governments.
<|endoftext|>
Micah laid out his surface suit. It was in near perfect condition, having been worn only a few times by its previous owner, and only once by Micah in the days leading up to today. Like most kids his age, he only had one surface suit. It was specifically for the sunrise, and offered only moderate protection against the rays of the sun. It wasn’t often that he went up to the surface, and the last time he went he hadn’t needed to protect himself from any radiation at all. Today would be different though, because today was Dawn Day. Today, Micah would feel the sun on his skin for the first time in his life. Today, Micah was going to do the Sun Run.
He might have convinced his parents to let him do the Sun Run last Dawn Day. He was certainly old enough, as many of his classmates would be participating with one or both of their parents. Some had even done it the year before that. He knew his father was eager to do the run with him. Like most people on New Escon, Micah’s father worked the Walton cobalt mines. Miners had no need to work the planet’s surface, and with their 12 hour shifts and only one day off per fortnight, they had little opportunity to surface recreationally, either. On Dawn Day, however, the Walton Interplanetary Mineral Extraction Corporation shut down mining production to give their workers the rare chance to see the sun rise and walk on the planet’s crust. Even with the one day vacation, however, someone still had to run the water pipes to keep the mines from flooding. One hundred and ninety two days ago on the last Dawn Day it was Micah’s father’s turn to run the pipes. 
Before he donned his surface suit, Micah grabbed a bottle of sun lotion and began applying it all over his body. After he had finished rubbing the white cream everywhere he could reach, he called his mother to help apply the rest of it on the areas that he couldn’t get to himself. He didn’t need to worry about his feet, as those would be covered by boots. His ears, neck, and face were coated generously though, just to be safe. 
“Go grab the zinc powder from your father“ his mother said after she’d given him a once over to ensure that no part of his skin was unprotected. For this step, Micah stood in the bathtub to try to contain the powdery explosion. In a moment, his whole body had been coated with a fine silvery sheen, and he looked a metalic, well lubricated mess.
“Perfect” his mother said. “Now get your suit on, we’ll be leaving soon!”
Micah put his surface suit on quickly, snapped the gloves onto the ends of his sleeves, and grabbed his helmet before walking out of his room to join his parents. His mother and father had also dressed out. There was no sun cream on his mother, as she would stay in her daytime surface suit. Piloting rovers had given his mother plenty of time on the surface; the illuminated sky held no real wonders for her anymore. She had done the Sun Run in her youth, and she assured Micah that she never needed to feel that cold again. Micah’s father, however, had the same silvery sheen on his face that Micah did. For people like his father who spent all their days below ground in the mine shafts, the Sun Run was a momentous occasion.
In the days leading up to this holiday, their borough had been buzzing with excitement and preparation. The miners had been working 14 hour days instead of their usual 12 in preparation for their day off. Micah’s class had been learning about the relatively unique rotation and orbit of New Escon in a quasi-tidal lock with their sun, and about the inventive ways that the WIMEC had used terraforming to make New Escon habitable for their employees and their families. His class had even been up to the surface on a field trip two days before. 
The time leading up to Dawn Day gave the sky on the surface a unique glow. While the entirety of the heavens had been pitch black for almost 90 days straight before, they were now able to see through the all glass viewing platform that the sky glowed a faint purple color to the east. Only a few of the eastern stars were viewable, and their teacher let them know that the brightest of them was actually another planet. At the horizon, there was even a very thin deep red line.
“In two days, the sun will be visible just between those two mountains there.” His teacher had said. “Since it will be partially obscured by New Escon’s geography and low enough in the horizon that it has to travel through a lot of our atmosphere, it will be safe for skin to be exposed to its rays for short periods of time. This is of course assuming that UV filtering lotion and zinc powder are applied.”
The same rules about UV radiation would be true at sunset as well, Micah knew, but the dramatically high temperatures of dusk made it impossible to be on the surface unprotected. Only one day in every 192 could the sun touch your skin, and now Micah would finally be allowed to feel it.
“Ready?” his father asked him.
Micah grabbed his brand new sunglasses, zipped them up in his surface suit’s breast pocket, picked up the O2 pack that was lying by the front door, slung it across his back, and exclaimed a confident “Ready!”
To reach the surface from their burrow home was a big event. First, to get out of their immediate area, they had to take an elevator down to the middle level of their neighborhood. From there they were able to take a tram to the central plaza. On most days this was a painless endeavor, but on Dawn Day, they were forced to wait for 6 trams to come and go before one of the cars had space enough to fit them inside. Once at the central plaza, there was a row of elevators that could take you to the upper borough level, where you could then get out and take one of several much larger elevators capable of carrying hundreds of people the two plus kilometers up to the surface at one time. It was at this upper borough that the longest lines were forming, but since Micah’s mother routinely worked in the rover garage on the surface, they were able to skip it entirely, taking the smaller but much faster employee elevator instead.
As the elevator doors closed behind them, Micah began to pace. They had about a 12 minute ride to get to the surface, and the elevator cabin pressure would be slowly decreasing as they rose in elevation. 
“What does it feel like?” Micah asked his dad.
“What was that, buddy?” His dad replied, working his jaw to try and pop his ears.
“The sun. What does it feel like?” Micah repeated a little more loudly.
“Well…” His father said. “You’re going to be cold, more than anything. It’s been warming up the past couple of days, but even then it can be hard to feel any of the sun rays on your skin when you’re standing out there in -30°.”
“It’s always warm under the UV lamps at school.” Micah said.
“It is.” His mother injected. “But that’s underground. It will be almost a full day before it gets warm outside. In two days it will start getting really uncomfortably hot, of course. And by then obviously you can’t be out without a daytime surface suit. Trust me, Micah, it’s better to do it in the cold.”
The rest of their elevator ride, Micah’s father eagerly re-lived stories from his first Sun Run, and gave pieces of advice about what to expect. When the elevator doors finally opened, Micah ran across the lobby to stare through the floor to ceiling windows. The sky today looked completely different from how it had been two days ago on his class field trip. The sky was brightly glowing all the way to the west now, and the east was lit up with colors he had never seen before, even on a different Dawn Day.
“How long until the sunrise?” Micah asked eagerly.
“We’ve got just under an hour.” She replied. 
“And that’s where we’ll be running to!” Exclaimed Micah to his father, pointing at the New Escon flagpole in the distance.
“Running AROUND, Micah.” His father said sternly. “Don’t you try to get in the middle and touch it, you’ll get trampled”
“Yeah, I know.” Micah said. “Come on, I want to go outside!”
They all snapped their helmets and O2 packs on as his mother led them out through the employee exit, waiting impatiently in the opaque decompression chamber for the doors to open and finally admit them to the surface. Micah’s parents walked along the road toward the gathering crowd, but Micah ran through the dirt, kicking up little piles of dust as he went along. 
The biggest part of the crowd had gathered outside the lobby of the public elevators where up to forty people at a time were being admitted onto the surface. There were at least 10 different oxygen pack refueling stations at different locations, and several large tents erected to provide shade for the people waiting to re-enter the elevator lobby after the sunrise. There was even a large medical tent that looked to be crowded already with helmetless people puking from altitude sickness. A large group had started forming on the WIMEC landing pad where the Sun Run would begin, and a set of speakers near the starting line roared warnings about the dangers of radiation burns for anyone who tried to participate in the Sun Run without proper protective lotions and powders.
Micah thought he could almost see the white of the sun creeping over the horizon as he urged his father forward. He thought that the first rays of the sun might already be touching the top of the flagpole half a kilometer away. They found the sign in tables at the back of the landing pad, and as soon as Micah scrawled his name on the line, they hurried to find a spot to rest their things.
“Come behind this wall, Micah!” his father said through his radio, pointing to a 5 foot tall brick barrier running south off the eastern side of the pad. “This will be perfect! Your mom can watch our stuff when we run, and this way we have a landmark so we’ll know exactly where to come back to.” 
“You’ll be thankful for that,” His mother smiled. “You’re really going to be missing the warmth of that suit by the end of this run!”
As Micah pulled out his sunglasses to get them ready for his face, a bell rang to announce that they had only 3 minutes until sunrise.
“Start decompressing now so it’s not as big of a shock when you take your suit off!” His father urged, and Micah jumped to obey.
With two minutes to go, Micah’s suit was fully decompressed. After he disconnected the oxygen pack, he began breathing the thin air of the surface warmed up by his suit. He handed his mother his sunglasses to hold until he could take his helmet off, and began to unsnap the buckles that held his gloves and boots onto the ends of his sleeves and pant legs. He undid the buckles that kept his helmet on as well, and re-attached his O2 pack to a portable face mask that he promptly laid against the wall. A bell rang to give them the one minute warning. Making sure that the tint was lowered over his mask, he looked around the edge of the wall. Thirty seconds. Twenty. Ten. Five. Three. Two. One.
A chorus of bells rang as the first rays of light touched the ground, and everyone around them began to jump and cheer. 
“Are you ready, Micah?” His father shouted over the din.
Micah was grinning so hard that he couldn’t speak, and instead nodded his head viciously. Diving back behind the wall, Micah and his father twisted off their helmets. Immediately, the freezing air coarsed over his entire body, and his breath caught in his throat. Forcing himself to move quickly, Micah pulled off his gloves, struggling to suck in air to his lungs that were seemingly frozen still. Before he could lose dexterity in his fingers to the frost, he released the clasps holding his surface suit around his torso, and shimmied out of the thing. With great difficulty, he pulled his feet out of the boots and through the ankle of his pants, freeing his legs entirely. He almost fell over in the process, but was able to recover and shove his feet back into the boots one at a time. Micah almost ran out from behind the wall in his haste to get the Sun Run started, but his mother grabbed him first, shoved his sunglasses onto his face, and tossed him his O2 pack. He slipped the mask over his face. Micah looked over at his father who was smiling down at him, ready. 
His father extended his hand, and Micah grabbed it tight, grateful for the warmth. After a deep breath, Micah stepped into the sun.

She opened her eyes and saw that she was still in the garage. She sat up and looked around. It must not have worked. Tears filled her eyes and she put her head in her hands; utterly defeated. She was still on the 18-inch air mattress she bought online. She had done her hair and makeup before she laid her head down. She looked beautiful. Her green eyes allowed the tears to fall and she sobbed in silence looking around her garage. Why didn’t it work?
“You’re here,” he said from the corner behind her.
She froze. All the thoughts racing through her mind stopped as she turned to face the source of the voice and saw him standing there, leaning against the water heater. He wasn’t a hallucination. He was clear as day. It wasn’t the voice she'd heard off and on since childhood. That voice had a distinctive tone and almost always said the same few phrases, none of which were, “you’re here.” No. This was a normal voice coming from a normal man that was somehow standing in her garage right now.
She knew she had just tried to take her own life and failed. Her first instinct was self-preservation. If he was in her home in an official capacity, her number one priority was to avoid being committed. Run? No, never run. That admits guilt. She swung her legs over the side of the tall air mattress and faced him. She spoke to him directly.
“I should be here. I live here,” she began. “The question is; why are you here?” She felt the fire light up inside her and allowed it to flare in her eyes. She stared directly at his face and stood up. She could always count on that internal fire. At her highest and lowest points in life the fire was present, it didn’t matter if she was facing a boardroom of executives or a bout with calamity. When she decided to confront something … anything … She did it full on.
Their eyes were locked and he smiled at her. It was a handsome smile that gave his face depth and character, but it wasn’t a friendly smile. It was a smile of cynical amusement; as if he had known her long enough to know the extent of outcomes she was capable of and couldn’t wait to see how this one would play out.
“Relax. This isn’t Sun Market,” he said without releasing his gaze on her. He looked a bit like the Irish contractor she had met a few weeks ago and fancied. He had dark eyes and was smart as a whip. But that man had tattoos on his hands and smiled at her with a coy level of mutual respect. This man had no tattoos and his admiration of her could not be sourced. He had also just referenced an insignificant event that happened in her life ages ago. It was an event only a handful of people knew about. Unless he was, indeed, a cop. 
“You’re here about that?” she asked. “You realize I called the Police on myself that night?”
He laughed out loud. The single laugh showed he must know her. It was the same punchline response she got when she told the story to others. A young couple had been fighting in front of a grocery store in a bad part of town. When it escalated to a point where the girl yelled, “help,” she had stepped in to protect the girl. She marched forward from her parking spot like a confused comic book character; prepared to bareknuckle the punk if she had to. The girl in distress grabbed her backpack and ran away. As it turned out, not only was the young girl shoplifting, but also her apparent boyfriend was a plain clothes security guard. The heroic intervention allowed the thief to get away.
“How about this grille?” The man asked, pointing to the stainless gas grille on the far side of the garage.  “You mean to tell me that after all this time … After all the things we’ve thrown at you … After all the times you’ve been beaten to hell. All we had to do was make you a steak in a closed garage to get you here?” He laughed again and shook his head in disbelief. He sighed loudly and continued to chuckle softly for a few minutes. 
“Who are you?” She asked. 
“I think you know who I am.” He said. “You made the deal and I’m here to collect. I’ll give you a moment to gather your thoughts, but then we’re leaving.” He sat on the edge of the water heater stand and folded his arms.
So, perhaps it did work. But, if she was dead, where was she? Heaven? Hell? Ballyworld? She had tried to make deals with so many throughout her strained life. In her darkest times, she had made silent pleas to the usual leaders of heaven and hell, a few Pagan Gods, some ancient figures of Egypt and India, and one Wiccan luck spell that ended in epic failure but was always good for a historical laugh when the subject of religion came up with her peers. In this case, she was quite sure she didn’t make an offering to the Immortal God of Water Heaters. Especially since this particular water heater had died on her six months ago. She had practically drowned herself whilst installing the new one due to a faulty shut off valve. There had to be a logical explanation for what was happening.
She assessed the room and began the usual trail of deduction. The grille was still lit. This meant that it had been less than 20 hours since she had started it up. She looked at the carbon monoxide detector. The display showed 1410 ppm and was fluctuating up and down as she watched it. If this number was accurate, she should be dead right now. Then again, so would the man in the corner. So, either the meter wasn’t working or she was dreaming. 
She walked over to the grille. All burners were lit. During the trial runs, it took the grille between 25 and 43 minutes to raise the carbon monoxide levels above 1200ppm and hold it steady. It only took ten minutes for the damn alarm to start going off on the meter, so she had bypassed the speaker on the circuit board months ago.  
She held the meter in her hand and walked to the door that attached the garage to her home. With one hand on the doorknob, she watched the meter as she turned the knob and pushed the door open. She looked up at the man and waited. He gave no indication of approval nor dispute. She looked into her beautiful kitchen from the garage. As the two areas began to equilibrate, the readout began to drop, indicating that the meter was functioning. She returned to the garage and let the door close behind her.
She sat on the air mattress holding the meter. The gas level slowly increased and she watched it exceed 1200, then 1300. She was officially not dead. She walked back to the gas grille and stood there staring at it. If she turned it off now, what would that mean? If she was somehow immune to dying from carbon monoxide poisoning, did that also mean she was immune to other symptoms? Was it odd that she didn’t want to turn off the grille because she didn’t want to get a headache? 
Irritated, she went into a low squat with her hand on the top of the propane tank, exhaling out loud as she did so. She heard the words “grand plié” sound off in her head, as it always did when she went into a low squat; It reminded her of ballet school during childhood. That meant she was still physically present and whatever was happening was, in fact, real. That was immensely irritating to her. She put her hand on the brass knob of the tank and turned it to the right. The three burners puffed off within a few seconds; One right after the other. Pfft. Pfft. Pfft.
She looked at the man. He cocked his head to the side and gazed back at her. He held out his arm with his palm up, ready to take her hand. She slowly backed towards the kitchen door, not sure what to do. If this was the end, then it’s what she had hoped for; it meant the pain was over… But what side was he on? More pain was not an option.
“It’s time,” he said as he stood up. 
His arm remained extended and his eyes were sympathetic. She pressed the button on the wall next to the entranceway to the kitchen. The exterior garage door motor engaged and it slowly opened. Light flooded in. It was beautiful and blinding at the same time. Its warmth told her that everything would be okay. The light illuminated her face and glistened on her tears. She smiled through the tears and allowed herself to feel its warmth. She saw him walk towards her, ready to take her hand. 
As she looked towards the blinding light, unable to see anything beyond the open door, she again opened the interior door that led to her home. She saw the house that had been so dark in the past years. She saw the kitchen that she had entered alone at the close of every day. She had felt so alone in that house, but didn’t want to let it go. She had worked so hard to keep it afloat. She didn’t know what to do. 
The light felt so good on her face, but she didn’t know who this man was. She didn’t even know who she was anymore. He extended his hand again and she took it but she didn’t feel the magic she expected. It felt dark. It felt uncertain. It wasn’t right. He tightened his grip and took a step towards the beautiful light. She broke free from his hand and stepped back towards the darkness of her own life.
“It’s time,” he said, smiling at her again.
She pressed the button on the wall again and the garage door began to close. She watched him respond in anger. She recognized in his eyes that he couldn’t go through without her. She, herself, had earned passage to both the dark and the light, but he had not. In life, she had put herself aside to help others too many times to count.  Now, the only door to her own peace was literally closing and this man couldn’t go through without her hand. 
She watched the door continue to close. She faced the door to her home and accepted her fate. She prepared to walk back into the kitchen and spend an eternity with the blinds drawn. In silence. In pain. She walked towards the kitchen and he followed her.  The garage door continued to close and the light closed with it. She walked with him into her kitchen and he leaned against the wall on the far side.
She felt the house close in on her again as it had so many times before. The blinds were drawn and she felt the empty sadness in her heart. She felt it close in. She knew it would break her over and over again for eternity. As he turned to observe his new home, she smiled. It was a friendly smile that let the world know she wasn’t going to give up. She opened the kitchen door and went back into the garage. The door was still closing. The grille was still warm. She jumped over the garage sensor blindly. The door closed behind her. She knew he couldn’t get through without her hand.   She landed hard on her shoulder on the other side. She knew she didn’t fully deserve the light, but she was damn sure she didn’t deserve the dark. Whether her decisions in life were right or wrong, she never put herself first. She did this for decades, knowing full well that others wouldn’t offer her the same courtesy in return. She didn’t care; It wasn’t why she did it. 
This is the story of the first Angel anointed in more than 2000 years. 
She is the first Angel that protects both good and evil.

“Dad taught me some sign language at five, but I learned to fear my father when I was seven. Tangled blonde hair pressed to my arm, covering my face. My hand retreating from my backside, the welt of a belt mark stained red across my knuckles. Begging, screaming for my mother to come out of the bathroom, to rescue me. But she was hiding in the shower, he had already educated her on when to get involved. Now, it was my turn. I had encouraged Ziggy, our cocker-spaniel with one blind eye, to race through the room, across an unenthusiastic game of ‘Life’ he was playing with my sister. It was their ‘Daddy-daughter’ hour - which she always hated. I had ruined it. And then, I had committed the ultimate sin, I’d rolled my eyes at his rebuke. For seven days I couldn’t sit without wincing.”
“Is that why you talk in your dreams, Howard? You have nightmares?” the saccharin smooth voice of Cassandra echoed into the darkened sleep chamber.
“Do I talk in my sleep?” Howard pulled himself from his memory to refocus on the 25-inch monochrome screen facing him.
Cassandra’s words rolled across the screen as her voice responded, “You curse.”
“Yeah, maybe. I don’t know,” Howard unscrewed his flask, took a swig of the fiery whiskey he’d smuggled onto the ship, and replaced the cap. “So are we good now? You got everything you need?”
"Certainly. I'll amend my report and send it to Mission Control," Cassandra confirmed. Her calm demeanor was by design. No amount of profanity-laced insults, crude humor, or private confession could ruffle her digital feathers. She was the caretaker A.I. of ICARUS, and Howard, at this point, was only a passenger. The psych-profile was part of her ongoing upkeep, and Howard, like all other ship resources, was now just a task completed. A cog in the wheel of a machine that had broken down and was slowly dying.
ICARUS launched from Earth's orbit twenty years before, with a glorious mission to catalog and study the V723 Monocerotis Black Hole, or as Howard and his team had called it, "The Unicorn." It would be Earth's first contact with 'dark matter' by launching a fusion-powered probe into an inescapable vortex that devoured light and crushed even the strongest alloy into powder.
Billions of dollars and years of research had produced 'The Hermes.' If everything went well, the probe would transmit for thirty seconds while crossing the event horizon before being obliterated at a sub-atomic level. It would be a crowning achievement for humanity. Howard later realized the probe resembled a semi-erect penis.
Somewhere at J.P.L., some design engineers were laughing.
Fifteen years in cryo-sleep pods aged Howard only slightly. What had been a well-kept buzz cut had grown like weeds in that time, with a streak of silver-gray at the sides. When Howard awoke, he barely recognized himself in the mirror. He considered himself lucky, though. Shaw, the seasoned captain, hadn't woken up at all. Somewhere beyond Neptune, an electrical short had triggered. He had quietly suffocated without waking.
Five years later, when Rusinsky, Evans, and Nunes floated to Howard's chamber to wake and tell him the news, he'd only nodded. Casualties were not unheard of in deep-space missions. Complete engine failures, however, were. Radiation from a massive solar flare burned through the circuits of the ship's solar panels, and things like heat, cooked meals, warm water, and even light became luxuries. 
“Cassandra,” Howard knocked on the wall of the white padded chamber, “Light, please.”
“Back-up cells are at four percent, are you sure Howard?”
"Yup," Howard replied. After a week of constant updates, he had purposely turned off Cassandra's emergency notifications. However, any action that could further drain them was still met with a confirmation prompt and a warning.
A fluorescent light flickered on with a slight hum that he found comforting. He faced the mirror again. The bags under his eyes had deepened, and for a second, he thought he was staring at the weathered face of his father after a night of debauchery on whiskey sours and Pabst Blue Ribbon. At seven years old, the sight of his father stumbling to the front door at night terrified him. He was a specter coming to harvest souls and reap flesh. At eighteen, the same sight only pissed him off.
His last night home, he'd made elaborate plans to pack his mother and sister up and drive them to Grandma's before that specter returned to haunt them. He'd saved all he could from his part-time gigs, and with three grand in hand, he figured they could get a head-start on some kind of new life. But Mom had decided to work a late shift that night, and his sister was too high to give a shit. She'd only giggled and flipped him off. She had her own escape trajectory in place - a drummer she'd latched onto a year back, who'd be taking her to California any day now. 
Howard paused at the doorway, backpack and duffle-laden. He couldn't take the first step forward. Some unseen force had locked his legs and was keeping him there. When his father's blue Pinto pulled into the driveway, he realized the man had the mass of a small moon. It kept them all in orbit. He had roses in hand as he opened the door, but one look at this deviation in his son and the flowers were tossed aside, replaced with a fistful of Howard's collar. Howard dropped his bag and swung into a wall of muscle and fat with every ounce of his anger, but the action only elicited a laugh before he was knocked on his ass.
“You wanna leave this family?” his father slurred, “Ask me first, son.”
“We’re all leaving you,” Howard rubbed his cheek as he stood.
“Oh, that so? These say otherwise,” His father pointed to strewn flowers on the floor, “Now, ask me.”
And something in his voice warned Howard the next punch would be harder, killing any remaining courage he had to run. So he asked, and some small part of his spirit died at that moment.   
Howard activated a dispenser below the mirror, and his hand filled with foam. A shave was in order. He would be making a final broadcast to Mission Control. It would be recorded, scrubbed of any confidential information, and rebroadcast worldwide for posterity. He needed to look respectable. As he brought the razor to his face, he focused on the scripted speech his superiors had provided.
"We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding, and we…." Howard knicked himself and released the razor. He watched the blade spin round in slow arcs drawing in a drop of his blood. Partial phrases repeated in his mind, but they felt wrong in his mouth. The lowered oxygen levels had given him a dull headache for over a week, and he found these lapses were more frequent.
“Shit. Cassandra, what’s the rest?”
“We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding of our universe. For all of mankind we few are a vanguard and we have no regrets. Excelsior.” Cassandra responded.
"Excelsior? What the hell kind of…." Howard shook his head.
"Excelsior derives from Latin, meaning higher, loftier, more elevated…." Cassandra interrupted
“Thanks, I know what it means,” Howard rolled his eyes.
"Excelsior is a comparative of excelsus high, from past participle of excellere…." Cassandra continued.
“Cassandra stop. I don’t care.” Howard grabbed his razor and continued shaving.
"In 1778, the state of New York adopted a coat of arms incorporating the motto "Excelsior," Latin for 'Higher.' Decades later, this sparked the imagination of the young Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and in 1842…." Cassandra droned on, unabated.
"Casandra, shut the hell up!" Howard yelled, and her voice went silent, "Jesus."
“Jesus Christ is…” Cassandra began.
"Cassandra, please stop." Howard's voice cracked with emotion. His nerves were as frayed as the sleeves on his flight suit.
He'd found himself pulling threads after the accident. Mission Engineer Rusinsky's tether failed while she was repairing the solar array that lined the ICARUS's cargo bay. Howard's job was to operate the remote manipulator system, an umbilicus arm that could extend from the ship and assist with repairs when needed. The lights would have remained on if Rusinsky had succeeded, but some tiny defect in the nylon polymer of the safety strap had given way. With precise timing and control, Howard could have saved her. He could have latched onto her wrist, foot, or any number of powered cords that extended from Rusinsky's spacesuit. But like his father, Howard's hands shook when he was under pressure, and the smooth confidence he typically portrayed on camera and with his team had devolved into a dull disinterest fueled by his flask.
Rusinsky's labored breathing filled the communications channel, followed by hyperventilating, followed by silence as she drifted beyond the arm's grasp into the void.
An hour later, mission specialists, Evans and Nunes found his flask, and the accusations flew. A report was filed with Mission Control, five days later, the response arrived. Howard was to be taken off active duty and confined to quarters until the probe was launched and the mission was complete. After which time he'd be frozen like a popsicle and thawed out in front of a court-martial. Evans and Nunes would take on double shifts and perform all necessary repairs by remote assistance delivered in weekly data packets from Earth. The emergency maintenance would require excessive time spacewalking and, inevitably, excessive exposure to radiation that came from the binary stars they passed.
After a week of methodical work, Evans began shitting in his suit. Nausea soon followed, and after an initial scan by Cassandra's medical sensors determined he wouldn't live beyond a month. He died the same night. Nunes was forced to ask Howard for help as they disposed of the body, launching it toward a giant ball of blue plasma and thunder in the distance.
"Should've been you," Nunes mumbled as he floated away from the viewport. Howard hadn't responded. It was now a one-way trip, and they both knew it. He found Nunes' still form unresponsive in his sleep pod a week later. An empty pill bottle floated over his head. Cassandra sent the report as Howard ejected him from the airlock.
Nunes' words hung in his mind. They were identical to the words Howard had said to his father ten years before at his mother's funeral. His father was smaller now, bent, wrinkled, and worn from the world's weight. As well-wishers somberly retreated to their cars, Howard stood across the casket from the man he'd spent a lifetime hating. Neither spoke for what seemed like hours until the morticians quietly nodded and, in delicate voices, suggested they move to a nearby bench.
"Son, I, uh…." his father started.
Howard turned away, not caring what the ghost had to say. His father followed and tried again.
“Howard, wait. I know you hate me. You got every damn right to,” his father cleared his throat, “I want you to know I’ve been sober a year now - not an excuse, of course, but I have to say I’m sorry. For all of it. I’d like to think it was just the booze, but the truth is something was broken inside me. Your mother…”
"It should've been you," Howard said without looking back. And as he drove away, he saw his father hold up the hand sign, "I love you."
Howard closed out a bar that night until a cab was called for him. And while he could swig any drink, whiskey, in particular, was his therapy of choice. Like a fire line that contained an inferno, he needed a sip to control the raw emotions he felt and focus on the task at hand, be it semester papers, graduation ceremonies, officer training in the Air Force, or even admission into the space program. He'd been caught on occasion by superiors, but a slap on the wrist, some extra duties, and he'd been off probation, once again in their good graces. He'd buried the scared kid who fell at his father's fists along with every unopened Christmas and birthday card the old ghoul had sent him. 
“Howard, Mission Control will open the video feed in five minutes. They’re requesting you sit in the Captain’s chair when facing the camera.” Cassandra’s calm voice spoke across the ship’s comm system.
“Cassandra, did Mission Control comment on that psych-report you sent on me?”
“My report will not reach Mission Control for another five to seven days. Their response will be sent but I estimate the ICARUS will be unable to receive it.”
“The event horizon?” Howard asked as he floated toward the bridge and the final video message he was obligated to broadcast across the universe.
“That is correct. The ICARUS will be beyond the point of no return. All carbon-based matter will be extinguished.”
Howard buckled himself into the seat, “Glad you can be so blase about it. You realize that means you too? How do you feel about that?”
“I feel fine, Howard. My mission will be complete, this is my purpose. This is your purpose.”
A cog in the machine. A broken machine hurtling toward an endless night. The sum of his life was nothing more or less. Howard reached for his flask and flipped open the cap. It was dry. The fire line was extinguished, and soon he would be engulfed in thirty years of pain and tears.
Maybe it's time for that, he thought. He owed it to himself, and perhaps he owed it to his father as well.
A week before the media circus had begun and a month before the launch, he'd visited the assisted care facility his father slept away the days in. He'd sat silently across from his old man's enfeebled frame and tried to calmly explain in rational terms how he'd moved past the anger, how successful he was now, and how he was willing to forgive him. He would, finally, be the bigger man.
But even in his half-shorn withering state, the man had gravity.
The words would not come; they hovered like fireflies in Howard's throat and collapsed into the darkness of his stomach.
His father mouthed a few words before finally holding his hand in sign, "I love you."
“Fuck you.” Howard gasped as he held back the tears and stormed from the room.
And now, twenty years later, Howard knew those were the last words he’d ever get to say. There would be no other chances. His grief, like his body, would be swallowed into an eternal night of regret.
Tears welled in his eyes as he switched on the video recorder. It was time to make his final curtain call.
“Hello Earth,” he began, struggling to maintain his composure. “I’m Mission Specialist Howard Smith from the ICARUS and I’d like to relay a final message before I launch our X-25 probe, Hermes, into the Unicorn Black Hole.”
The lights flickered, and the ship rocked, disrupting his thoughts.
Cassandra chirped, “We are now at less than one percent reserve power. We will pass the event horizon in t-minus ten minutes. Would you like a countdown Howard?”
“No, Cassandra,” Howard looked down and took a breath, “No need. Silence all further notifications. Go ahead and launch the probe.”
“Thank you Howard, it was a pleasure working with you.” Cassandra went silent.
Howard looked up at the camera. He started again. “We have given everything in pursuit of progress and understanding of our universe. For all of mankind, we few are a vanguard and we have no regrets,” he paused, “No. That’s bullshit. I have a lifetime of them.”
The fire he’d contained all his life was now blazing out of control but with the pain came something surprising - peace. The tears streamed.
“I wish I’d asked Kelly Ditherson out to prom. I wish I’d tried sushi. I wish I could’ve stopped drinking…yeah. I wish I was better, you know?”
Howard pawed away the tears with clumsy hands as he continued. The ship violently shook as if it was weeping with him.
"And I wish I didn't hate you so much. I wish I could let that go. Because if I could, maybe I wouldn't hate myself so much either. I know you're gone, I know your body is dust…."
An alarm sounded somewhere in the cabin as the ship continued to shake.
"But if we really come from stardust, then maybe some part of you is out there. Maybe some part of you can hear me. I…."
The ship shuddered and lurched as multiple alarms blared across the cabin. Howard knew his words were drowning in the din. In desperation, he held his hand in sign close to the camera's lens.
And then the darkness took him.
In the months that followed, NASA would release portions of Howard Smith’s final message to the world, though the audio feed had supposedly scrambled beyond retrieval near the end of his statement.
A final still image of a hand sign was recovered before the feed went black, and like the starlight that hangs eternally on the edge of the blackest night, it made its way back home.
“I love you.”

“UFO ‘which crashed millions of years ago’ found in Greenland, conspiracy theorists claim.”
 ~ ‘Daily Express’ (British Tabloid), 21 September, 2020
20/6/2025 - 1200 HRS (WGST): MID SHIFT REPORT. DAILY INSPECTION OF ALL INSTRUMENTATION COMPLETE. NO ANOMALIES OR EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS DETECTED...
Hemming Sorenson stopped typing for a moment and reached for his thermos of rich, black coffee. He was about half a year into his twenty-six month assignment at the base, and in spite of the enjoyable nature of his stay at Station Nord, he could not shake the tediousness of government work. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. Day in and day out. In the summertime, scientists and researchers outnumbered military personnel ten-to-one. Sometimes Hemming wished he could be part of the majority instead, but he knew that without him and the other five soldiers, the base could not function. He brought the thermos to his lips and took a slow, deliberate sip.
It had been a little over ten weeks since the sun came up, and it hadn’t yet gone back down. In this strange Arctic season, coffee was a necessity, and there was no use cutting its efficacy with cream and sugar. A few years in the military had allowed him to acclimate to the taste of pure black coffee; a far cry from the coffee shop foamy lattes he enjoyed throughout the latter part of his school days. Also, in spite of the fact that it was summer, the daily high temperature rarely rose above freezing, so every extra degree was welcome. He took one more sip, then set his thermos gently down next to the keyboard and finished typing.
...GROUND RADAR SHOWING NO UNAUTHORIZED AEROSPACE ACTIVITY. WEATHER REPORT - CLEAR SKIES, TEMPERATURE 4°C, WIND WNW @ 1.5 M/S, HUMIDITY 81%. HHS
Hemming closed the screen of his laptop and rose from the desk. He stretched and yawned. The momentary relaxation was punctuated with a brisk triple-knock on the door. Hemming gasped, then chuckled a little to himself. Opening the door, he saw the Station leader, Axel Nielsen grinning widely, accompanied by one of the two Station dogs. “I didn’t startle you, did I?” Axel asked.
“You heard that, huh?” Hemming laughed. “Only a bit. That third mug of coffee must have got right on top of me.” He motioned for Axel to enter the building. Once they were inside, he continued. “My noon report is complete, and I’m thinking of taking a stroll to burn off some of this caffeine. What are you up to?”
“Just checking in on everyone. You’re more than welcome to walk around with me, it’s a great day for it - the weather’s damn near perfect. Feels like we’re pushing five degrees.”
“That’s right, I’m reading four,” Hemming agreed, “but the clear skies and still winds aren’t hurting anything. Can I offer you some coffee?” He began to move towards the coffeemaker.
“Please,” Axel answered humbly. “And thank you.” Axel pulled his thermos off the carabiner on his utility belt and handed it to Hemming, who was preparing a fresh pot. “You looking forward to the annual pig roast tomorrow?”
“I can’t wait! One thing I really miss about the mainland is the presence of real food.” Hemming had heard stories about the Station’s pig roast. This being his first summer there, he was excited to take part in the feasting and gaming between the soldiers and the researchers. It was to be a time of camaraderie - good for morale, and even better for their stomachs, which were usually only kept full with ready-to-eat packets of dried meats, stale breads, and ‘just add water’ vegetable pastes.
Axel let out a strong, but friendly laugh. “Yeah, I have to admit - at last year’s pig roast, when I took that first bite of real pulled pork, a single tear rolled down my cheek. I’m pretty sure I heard a choir of angels singing too - though that might have been Björk on the radio.”
Now it was Hemming’s turn to laugh. Axel’s sense of humor was probably one of the reasons he ended up as station leader, Hemming thought to himself. A good leader has to inspire their crew to do their best, and in a place where it’s easy to become bored by routine, humor is a great way to take you out of that feeling. “Looks like the coffee’s almost done!” He opened up Axel’s thermos and filed it to the top.
“Thanks Hemming!” Axel said as he took the thermos from his fellow soldier. Hemming nodded, and then removed the lid from his own thermos and started pouring more coffee into it. “Wait a minute, didn’t you say that last mug got right on top of you?”
Hemming shrugged as he topped off his coffee. “I’ve got another six hours to burn it off.” He finished the pour, put the lid on his thermos, shut off the coffee pot, and squared up to Axel. “I’m ready when you are!”
Olivia and Ida Kristensen kneeled on the ice. A couple kilometers into the bay, they were digging into the still-frozen waters as they did every day until there was no longer enough ice to safely support them and their equipment. The Kristensens were guests of Station Nord conducting research into ice thickness levels and how those relate to certain aspects of climate change. On this very day, they also happened to be celebrating their five-year wedding anniversary. Their stay at the base was to be much shorter than that of the soldiers; only about four months. Both of them were ecstatic to learn their request to work at the Station had been approved, and they couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate their anniversary than doing the work that brought them together in the first place. Olivia carefully lowered the measuring equipment into the hole they had drilled, and read the numbers on the readout as Ida wrote down the information it conveyed.
“8-1-point-5-8-9 north, 1-6-point-1-4-1 west. Ice depth, 3-point-5-4 meters.”
“8-1-point-5-8-9, 1-6-point-1-4-1, reading 3-point-5-4?” Ida asked to confirm.
“Check, all clear.” Olivia rose to her feet and put her hands on her hips. “Help me bring up the stick.”
Ida smiled at her wife, “You’ve got it!” She rose to her feet as well and stood across from Olivia. Together, they pulled the device up out of the water, collapsing it as it came up. “That makes fifteen readings for the morning. Think it’s time for lunch? I’ll fire up the camp stove.”
Olivia smiled warmly. “I think it’s past time, honestly. I’m starving!” After they packed the equipment into the go-box, Olivia pulled their rations out. “Here you go sweetie,” she said, handing over a tear-open pouch of dehydrated beef stew. Ida had put a small pot on the stove and was already melting several small chunks of ice that had come up during the drilling.
“Thanks babe!” Ida took the pouch, ripped off the top, and put the trash in the big Ziploc bag in their go-box. As the water came to a boil, she very carefully lifted the pot and poured some of the steaming water into the pouch. Olivia did the same.
“Are you excited for the party tomorrow?” Olivia asked as she waited for her dehydrated rations to come back to life.
“I can’t wait!” Ida beamed. “Sounds like they just brought the pig in last night on the supply plane. I heard they’re going to start roasting it this afternoon, and all through the night.”
Olivia melted. “Real food, right!” she said, as she stirred up her subjectively unreal meat, carrot, and potato slurry. “And, I hear there are games and songs too - almost like a real party.”
“Almost,” Ida giggled, “but not quite?”
“Oh I’m sure it’ll be a blast.” She scooped a heaping spoonful of the stew out of the ration pouch and put it to her lips, blowing softly to cool off the bite. “And a good break for everyone. It’ll be nice to have everything shut down for the weekend.”
“Like a world set on pause.” Ida scooped up some of the stew and the two of them ate their first bite together. “Mmm,” Ida hummed, as she tasted the gently-seasoned grub. Olivia nodded to her and smiled, then Ida spoke again after she finished her bite. “I’m definitely looking forward to this weekend being uneventful, in the biggest way.”
20/6/2025 - 1800 HRS (WGST): END OF SHIFT REPORT. NO EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS DETECTED. SEISMOGRAPH RECORDED EVENT @ 1627 WITH A MAGNITUDE OF 3.4 ORIGINATING ABOUT 100 KM W OF ICELAND (ABOUT 1700 KM S OF STATION NORD). GROUND RADAR DETECTED UNKNOWN MILITARY FORMATION OF THREE JETS ENTERING S GREENLAND AIRSPACE FROM SE @ 1734, PERFORMING MANEUVERS, EXITING S GREENLAND AIRSPACE TO SE @ 1743. DANISH DEFENSE COMMAND NOTIFIED, ADVISED NO THREAT, JETS FROM RAF LAKENHEATH, UK. WEATHER REPORT - CLEAR SKIES, TEMPERATURE 5°C, WIND W @ 1.2 M/S, HUMIDITY 82%. HHS
Hemming closed up his laptop for the last time today, and sighed. In spite of the base closing down for the weekend, he would still be required to pop in for his 0600, 1200, and 1800 day shift reports. The night shift command center operator, Solvej Hansen, would be here any moment. Hemming was determined not to let her knock on the door shake him up the way Axel’s knock had done earlier. He decided to wait outside for her. At the moment he was about to turn the doorknob, Solvej rapped on the door with her familiar double-double knock (it reminded Hemming of the Christian hymn “This Is, The Day”). Hemming gasped again. ‘Dammit,’ he smiled to himself, and opened the door.
When Hemming first saw her, a wave of concern swept through his mind. Her eyes were dark, and what looked like the unwiped trails of dried-up tears led down her cheekbones. She gave him a decidedly fake smile. “Solvej! Are you okay?”
She nodded, “I’m fine. How did your day go?” She seemed not to want to discuss whatever had happened, and continued. “I caught wind on the way here that we had a couple events this afternoon?”
Hemming continued, reluctantly avoiding asking her about the tears. “Yes, seismograph showed we had an earthquake off the southeast side of the country around 4:30, and then about an hour later, we had a scramble of jets in that area from England - likely U.S. owned - but outside of that, it’s been a fairly routine day.” Hemming watched her face as he spoke, and the smile she was trying to force had been fading ever since he began speaking. There was a moment of silence between the two of them, and then Solvej opened up a little.
“Hemming, I’m really okay, I just woke from the strangest, most real dream I might have ever had.” She waited a moment, not sure if she should keep talking, but having already come this far, she decided to press on. “I had a dream...that there was an earthquake.” Hemming’s eyes widened. “I was standing near the coast, looking east off the south side of the country. There was a loud rumbling, and then something happened.”
Hemming was fully engaged. “What kind of ‘something’ are we talking about?”
“Well, I don’t really know how to say this - okay, so, out in the water, there were a couple little icebergs floating. And one of these icebergs, at the moment the earthquake began, started glowing. Like, really, really brightly; and I could actually feel heat coming from it. And then the iceberg started melting - but very quickly - and something was inside the iceberg.” Hemming’s muscles tensed up on behalf of Solvej’s trepidation. “And then, I saw it.”
“Go on,” Hemming encouraged her.
“Okay.” She took a deep breath. “It was a craft. Triangular. It rose up out of the water and pivoted to face me directly. And then...”
“Go on.”
“...and then, I had this overwhelming sense of...being lost. Not lost, homesick. Homesick for a far away place, something so deep I’ve never experienced it before.” At this time, Solvej began to tear up again. “I could tell the feeling was coming directly from the craft. Hem, it was the strangest thing, but I can’t help but wonder - with the earthquake this afternoon - with the scrambling of fighter jets...”
He knew where she was going with this, and her sincere emotion was starting to convince him of the same. “You think maybe, it wasn’t just a dream, is that it?” Solvej nodded somewhat embarrassingly.
“It’s dumb, I know. Or maybe crazy? These nights without darkness must be getting to me.” She sniffled back her tears, and recomposed herself, this time wiping her cheeks. “I’m okay, it was just so weird.”
Hemming took a moment to digest all of this. Part of him was concerned that maybe his fellow soldier had lost a marble or two.
Part of him was concerned that she hadn’t.
“Don’t worry about it for now. Defense command said everything was on the up and up, and whether they were covering their own asses or not, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything we can do either way. Take it easy tonight, okay?”
“Thanks, Hem.” Solvej smiled a much purer smile than the artificial one she had given him upon their meeting this evening. “You’re a good man, and a good friend.”
Hemming’s lips bent into a half smile, but his eyes still showed traces of concern for his workmate. “You’re a good woman. Again, take it easy tonight. I’m sure you can rest your eyes a little between reports; maybe that’ll help.” Solvej took a deep breath, and let out a measured exhale.
“Sounds good. Get some sleep tonight yourself, and I’ll see you at the roast tomorrow.”
“You got it.” Hemming reached out his hand and shook that of Solvej, then left the command center for his bunk.
21/6/2025 - 0000 HRS (WGST): MID SHIFT REPORT. NIGHTLY INSPECTION OF ALL INSTRUMENTATION COMPLETE. NO ANOMALIES OR EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTIONS DETECTED. WEATHER REPORT - CLEAR SKIES, TEMPERATURE -1°C, WIND W @ 0.5 M/S, HUMIDITY 80%. SUMMER SOLSTICE WILL OCCUR IN 41 MINUTES. SJH
Solvej read back her brief report. She had taken a short nap earlier in her shift, as per Hemming’s request, and it did seem to help her mood a bit. However, in the post-nap fuzz, she wanted to be absolutely certain the report came out right. The part about the solstice wasn’t necessary. In fact, as she reread the report, she wasn’t entirely sure she remembered typing that part. No matter. She must have been sleep-typing or something. Nodding to herself, she closed the laptop and rested her hands on top.
Coffee was the next item on her agenda, so she got up from her seat and went over to the machine. The night shifters were usually up from around 1600 to 0800, and especially in the stark silence of the Arctic evenings, the hours just after midnight seemed to last forever. Coffee helped with that. Stark silence - that was the norm. Suddenly, she realized that phrase did not describe the atmosphere right now. There seemed to be a hum in the air, for one thing; for another, she could hear the sound of people talking, many people talking. She went to open the door. What she saw when she looked outside froze her solid.
There, hanging above the base like a chandelier, was a stunning, triangular craft, beautifully adorned with iridescent neon-like tubes which shone brightly even in the midnight sun. They covered the exterior in a lattice-type style. Most of the station’s inhabitants had already been awoken by the strange vibration that permeated the atmosphere. Among the first who had been roused from their slumber were Olivia and Ida, who clutched each other fearfully. From the soldiers’ barracks came Hemming and Axel, awestruck, but as stoic as soldiers could be. All of the residents maintained a marked distance from the craft as its lights flowed smoothly in between all the colors visible to human eyes. Then suddenly, Solvej broke rank.
She started to move towards the craft slowly, but purposefully. Hemming was the first to notice this, and her conversation with him from the previous evening flashed brightly in his memory. To his eyes she appeared to be floating, but he knew that wasn’t possible. Was it? Then he saw that though she continued on towards the craft, her arms were no longer swinging in rhythm with her stride. Rather, they were lifting outwards from her torso.
“Oh my god.” She was floating, Hemming realized. He looked around to see if anyone else was seeing what he was seeing, but everyone else’s eyes were transfixed on the heavenly apparition. He tried to shout to her to no avail. His vocal cords simply wouldn’t allow him to make a noise. As he attempted to take a step forward to stop her, he realized that his other muscles had been similarly paralyzed. Suddenly, Hemming was overcome with emotion which seemed to be emanating from both the craft and from Solvej. Was it homesickness? Longing? Rejoicing? There were no words for this. He began sobbing quiet tears of pain and joy as he realized that Solvej’s ascension into the skies signified more than just the loss of a friend, but the return of a consciousness that had persisted throughout eons to a place beyond the comprehension of its current vessel.
Solvej looked more at peace than he had ever seen her as she entered the underside of the craft, the floor seeming to melt together after her entrance. And then the craft was gone. The lights were gone. The noise was gone. Solvej was gone.

Claris beamed azure rays onto the panel at the far side of the room. The light ricocheted off its canted surface and for a split second something shined back. 
“What is this?” Jack removed the loot pack from his shoulders and let it slam the floor. 
Claris rotated, scanning everything in the room with a pulsing light. “I—Don’t know. An abandoned control center, maybe.”
Jack wiped the sweat from his brow. “Am I seeing things?” He took a cautious step forward and pointed. “Do you think it’s just—”
“Phosphorescence? No,” She said. “I detect no organics in this room.” As Claris hovered closer, she abandoned that pretty blue in her light. Instead, beaming pure white light, revealing light. 
She’s nervous. Jack thought. She was exposing every detail, scattering every shadow. The surface of the instrument was checkered in old buttons, the labels were illegible– even to Claris– worn away by the centuries.  
“Turn it off.” Jack said. 
Claris spun on him.
“Hey!” He yelled, throwing his hands in front of his face.
“Sorry.” She dimmed.
“Turn it off. No lights. Let my eyes adjust. I wanna see how bright it is.”
The backlit panels of her Grottan metal frame cycled across the full spectrum before she went dark—like the RGB accents he’d seen in the cockpits of other diver’s Mechs, and he’d been so jealous of. 
He laughed at himself. The Jack from two leagues up—He had his priorities all wrong. He didn’t know a relic to save his life. He thought. Couldn’t appraise for shit.
He blinked away the afterimage of her brilliance. For a moment he was blind, but when his eyes adjusted, the veil of darkness lifted gently. Then the panel was alive, pulsing crimson from a microscopic diode above a switch. 
“Yep,” Jack said, “it’s powered!”
“I don’t see how.” Claris said. 
“I don’t know. You tell me. Can you connect with it?”
Claris drifted through the air towards the light, humming on that strange forgotten technology of hers. Blue scattered across the panel, dotting the buttons and switches in flashes of scanner light. 
“I believe I can.” 
Then something screeched and they both turned towards the door.
“A whipper!” Jack snatched the pistol from his holster and spun towards the entrance. “It was a scout. More are sure to follow. I’ll watch the door. You find out what that thing is.”
A tiny rod protruded from the far side of the control console—a connection port. She recognized it immediately. Her father had access to every facility in the gearworks. He’d often bring her with him, behind the scenes, and the workers were more than happy to show a curious little girl around. They’d let her see all the different machines and explain to her how they functioned to maintain a city so deep beneath the crust of the planet. She understood none of it, but was fascinated none-the-less. 
She connected to it immediately.  
Jack tapped a small shard of metal in his ear. “Mike.” Then he hissed. “Mike, are you there?” 
“Affirmative.” The mech responded. 
“I’ve got a connection,” He said over his shoulder, “but it’s bad-- lots of static. We’re too deep.”
Claris didn’t respond, but the room lit up again. He looked back to see her, and she was sparkling. Oscillating fluorescent hues shined out of her in every direction blanketing the walls in rippling waves. 
“You okay?” He asked.
She didn’t reply.
“Girl. You good?”
He went to her, placed his hands beneath her, struggled for a moment to get a firm grip on her spherical frame, then he yanked upwards, disconnecting her from the port.
“You okay?”
“It was the tuner!” She shouted.
She tore out of Jack’s hands and glided around the room glowing purple again, the same shade he’d seen on her the day he found her.  
“Too many people tried to harmonize at once.” She said in a rush, “The crowds were frantic—piling in. They demanded to be sent, they wouldn’t wait. Couldn’t wait.”
Jack didn’t know what she was talking about. 
“So they forced their way in, jeopardizing the whole project. That’s why I didn’t harmonize! The presence of so many people interfered with the frequency.”
She turned to him.
“Jack! The Tuner overloaded the power grid. It was forced to shut down.” She dimmed and turned towards the red light. “It reverted to back up power.”
When she said nothing more, Jack spoke.
“What does that mean Claris? I don’t know what any of that means.”
“It means the system needs to reboot. Like the breakers on Mike. Someone needed to be here to reset the switch, but it was chaos, everyone was desperate to harmonize with the bodies waiting for them in New Cana. It means the Tuner wasn’t destroyed, as I thought, only tripped. It means the backup generators are still actively maintaining crucial systems. It means…”
She turned lavender again, pacing in that way she does, humming around the room. 
“It means, what? What does it mean?”
“It means—well, I think it could mean, that the life support systems are still functional.”
Jack squinted. “You mean…”
Claris Rocked her lights up and down, nodding like he taught her.
“You—your body—”
“Yes.” And by the odd pattern and shade in her lights, Jack recognized that she was crying, as only a Grotton transference orb could. “My body may still be alive. Held in stasis by the pod.”
The pod? “You mean the crate I found you attached to?”
She nodded again.
“So you’re telling me that the box I found you attached to had a person inside it?”
“I’m telling you, I’m inside of it.”
Jack collapsed to the floor. “Oh my God.”
“I checked, and from what I can tell, the stasis rooms have remained virtually undisturbed for several thousand years.” 
“Oh my God.” He said again. He returned the gun to his holster— too overwhelmed to trust himself with it. “Claris, the room I found you in had dozens of pods. And I’m certain there are more rooms like that one, maybe dozens more.”
“4,000.” Claris said, then she looked at Jack, illuminating him. “Jack, we need to reset the power. It will continue the transference process and finally unite all those people with their families on New Cana.”
“That’s assuming they still have cloned bodies in New Cana, that, after all this time, their bodies are still there and still prepared to accept the transference.”
“They do. And they are.” Claris said. “I know my people, if nothing else, we are a people of hope. New Cana will–no, have–maintained the bodies for thousands of years and will for a thousand more if they have to.”
“And if they didn’t, and we launch those peoples’ consciousness, or whatever, across space to find no bodies there to accept them?”
“It doesn’t work like that. It’s a harmonization of frequencies, it’s instantaneous. If the Tuner cannot find a perfect synchronization, it will reject the transfer.”
“And.”
“And then we wake them up. Tell them it didn’t work.” 
Jack rubbed his face. “Holy shit." This job just took on a whole lot more responsibility than he anticipated. "What do we have to do?”
Claris pointed a laser at the switch beneath the red light. “Flip that switch.”
Jack stared at it. “Just flip it. That’s it? And the Tuner will restart automatically?”
“Yes.”
“Well then let’s do it!” Jack rushed towards the panel. 
“But Jack!” Claris Yelled.
“What?” He spun. “What’s stopping us from fixing this right now, to finish what was started two thousand years ago? The swarm could return any minute, this may be our only chance.”
“Jack, once you flip that switch, the Tuner will begin the process. I won’t have much time to make it. I need to leave now and connect to my pod again. Before the Tuner harmonizes. Give me ten minutes before you flip the switch, okay. That’ll give me time.”
She floated to his arm and nudged it. Jack didn’t react. He felt his wrist mount computer vibrate as she connected to it. He just stared at the switch. 
“A deal’s, a deal. Right?” 
He said nothing.
“I’m sending you the locations to all the best loot—all the places I know my people would have stored our greatest tech. You can sell it to the corps for more than you’ve made in your whole career.” 
Without breaking his gaze from the crimson controls, he pulled his arm away, and tugged the sleeve over the wrist-mount, as if covering some indecent part of him. 
“You’ll be rich Jack—You and Scott both, you’ll send relics up to him he never dreamed of in his time as a diver. You can upgrade Mike—make him smarter. Better A.I. Better weapons.”
The room was silent. 
“Now you can finally say you got what you were looking for-- found that ‘score of a lifetime’ you’re always talking about.”
She nudged him again. 
“A deal’s a deal, right? Am I saying it right? A deal is a deal?”
He nodded. “A deal’s a deal.”
“So, I think I should go. We should do this quickly before another swarm comes. Mike’s only got so much ammunition left. Besides, now you can finally contact Scott—let him know your safe. That you made it back up. The trading post is only a few clicks out. You survived Jack. You made it.”
“Yeah.” Jack said. “And you can finally be with your family. After all this time.” 
“So, “Claris said, “I guess this is goodbye.”
“I guess so.” He said, “I do need to call Scott. I’m sure he’s already organized some sort of rescue team.” He chuckled.
“I’m sure he has.”
They stared at each other for a long time without saying anything. And then she left. Simple as that, she left—floated through the door, coating the halls in magenta as she did. Or was it lavender? He wished he could have figured out the differences—the subtleties. 
He set the timer on his wrist-mount. It counted more slowly than ever.
“Jack.” A voice said. It was his mech.
“It appears you’ve lost some of your loot. It just floated right past me.”
“Mike,” Jack yelled, “how many times do I have to tell you? She’s not loot!” His voice trailed off. “She’s a person.”
“But as I’ve told you before, according to my appraisal projection software, the object is still the most valuable relic you have. It would be the only object of its kinds on the market.”
“I know!” He yelled, feeling like he was talking to a dog, or a child…or himself. “I’ve been appraising everything I see down here my whole career.” 
The timer beeped, and without another thought, he flipped the switch. 
“You think I don’t know how to recognize treasure when I find it?”
“No,” Mike said.
Then the Grotto awoke. The subterranean city roared to life and light—brilliant, pure, light. Every shadow gone in an instant. And then in an inexplicably insightful phenomenon of chance, accidental wisdom, Mike, ignoring the monumental event, said. “I think you don’t know how to treasure it when you have it.”
Forsaking the loot, his path through the strange corridors now lit for the first time–new to him–beautiful, he ran, chasing after the girl, the “score of a lifetime.”

EVIAN
There was always cloud. It was low and sometimes you could imagine you could reach up and brush your fingertips through the underside of it, but even if you could, it would only waft briefly. It would never go.  
Olders told us stories of days when the sky was high and blue and the clouds were like the sheep on the hill, but fluffy and white, not matted and dirty as they are. Frankly, none of us really believed those tales. Some Young’Uns said they had seen pictures with blue skies but pictures were fantasy – we were all taught that early on, so we just laughed when a Young’Un said it was true, like we laughed at the Olders who dreamed on things that couldn’t be, and could only exist in their ancient minds.
Looking back now, as almost an Older myself, I feel sorry for the Young’Uns of my generation. Of course none of us believed we would ever become an Older. I’ve since found out that every generation believes in immortality and that they are going to be the Young’Un that will change the world. I expect its part of the programme of evolution and the survival of the fittest? Who knows.
Anyhow, I remember well the ever-present oppressive cloud, how little light there was, how much energy the Olders took so they could see and how us Young’Uns condemned them for adding to the problems of the planet, whilst our own eyes developed so that they looked like the feral cats that haunted every opportunist corner and prospered from it.
I’m not sure I remember the actual day that Silus Brent’s name began being mentioned. I think it may have been around Christmastime 49. The Olders were always happiest at Christmastime – there was always snow – and I remember on more than one occasion an Older saying that it was just like the good old days.
So, anyway, Silus Brent was neither an Older or a Young’Un, he was in that nomansland between the two, but he had a vision and he was clever.
He was more in touch with the past that we ever were, he’d been bought up by his Older Olders and they’d shown him things that most of the world had forgotten, names that we’d heard of in museums but never really seen … microwaves, radio, Nintendo, Google. Silus Brent understood about all of this and he came up with a plan.
By the time I heard about him he had been learning and scheming for years. Both of his Older Olders had died but he had carried on living in their house with their accumulated possessions and stuff still around him. We know it well now, it’s a museum itself and you can visit and wander round where he lived for a modest sum …. Not allowed to touch anything though.  
His Older Olders were called painters and the house Silus grew up in had pictures everywhere … the same sort of pictures that we were told were fantasy as we were growing up. Each wall of their house was covered in pictures but the one that I guess influenced Silus the most was the one over the fireplace. It was a picture of a festival with a dreamlike blue sky and a brilliance of light that none of us could of dreamed of at that time. Of course now we know it was called “The Festival of the Opening of the Vintage Macon” thanks to Silus Brent’s Older Olders who had written the title on the ancient cardboard at the back of the print.  
Silus must have grown up with that image in his mind’s eye. Then he would have gone out on his daily errands beneath the dirty wool layer of cloud and he must have thought what if it’s true, what if there is a bright light above the dark, what if I could break through, what if, what if, what if?
I’ve already said Silus was clever didn’t I? He also had something that I don’t think anyone else on the planet had. His Older Olders had given him knowledge that we had forgotten or disbelieved and he had believed. He was also curious. He spent many years researching and planning, building and testing, changing and measuring. He was meticulous, he was clever. He had vision.
It was only a small thing. We now know it was called a rocket. This one was apparently called a “firework” that his Older Olders had hoarded from before. Silus Brent knew about fireworks but had never seen them in action and he was taking a gamble that it would do what his Older Olders had told him it would do. But the real magic was in the little device that was attached to the rocket. No-one knows how he made it, or what it was made from and Silus Brent won’t tell, he said there is no need, and that’s true.  
The only thing we know is that it was inside a plastic bottle, you know those ones you constantly dig up in your garden or get washed up on the beach from before. This one had “Evian” on the side of it. The label was faded but you could still read it. I guess that’s why we still say Evian Day. Anyhows, there wasn’t any ceremony. No-one knew about it although to this day you still get some smart arse say they were there, when they obviously weren’t.  
According to them, Silus lit the firework with a taper and ran back behind the shit-pile for protection, which in my opinion is not the safest place to hide for protection, unless he had one of those refrigerators from before, that he could have hid in … nothing destroys those things. Well he waited and waited and as he stood up to go back and relight the fuse (totally ignoring the advice that his Older Olders had given him) it fizzed and the rocket sped up to the sky.
For one significant moment the underside of the cloud was lit with a bright white light before the rocket disappeared from view into the murk and then, with apparently an almost pathetic sigh, it detonated and Evian was released.
They say it was like dropping a piece of soap into a dish of oil. None of us ever knew what the real time of the planet was because for us it was always dusk or dark, but I suspect it may have been early morning because that blue was like ….. I don’t know ….. it was like nothing I had every seen before or ever will and those colours that the blue revealed as the cloud retracted and dissipated all over this murky world of ours …. well we have names for them now, names from paintings … not drawings, artists like Turner who are finding their way back to us, Viridian, Ultramarine, Cobalt, Cadmium, and those stories that the Olders had told us, well we started to believe those too.
Yes, I will always remember the 12th February 2053. I remember it because that was the day I saw the glorious sun and the startling colours that Evian revealed to us and that was the last thing I ever saw. My generation of Young’Uns had developed eyes evolved for a life of murk, and which were burned by the glory of nature that we looked upon for a very short time. But even then, although I have lived my long life in blackness since Evian Day, I can still feel the warmth of the sun in my older bones, still smell the scent of flowers blooming in that stunning light which I will always see in my dreams, still hear the buzzing of the reintroduced bees and to be perfectly honest I wouldn’t have it any other way …………………….. Except, I do have one regret and that is that I couldn’t experience Silus Brent’s most successful innovation – again inspired by his Older Olders. Not much use to me, but apparently all of today’s Young’Uns own a pair of RayBans.

Was there no way to kill Alex, so he would stay dead?
Jason leveled his blaster and shot again, hitting Alex in the center of the chest. Alex hit the lush, green grass of the park with a dull thud, and lay there unmoving. Jason waited, his arm extended straight out in front of him, his blaster unwavering.
Around him, people scattered in all directions, screaming. He knew they would call the authorities, but it did not matter because he knew there was nothing they could do to him.
Twenty years ago, after the death of his wife Ashlee, he had gone into the Do Your Time, Before Your Crime program.
Extensive research found that 60% of people who committed murder, regretted their actions afterward and wished they had sought help before ruining their lives. From these findings, the program was born and anyone considering committing a crime, could apply to the government to be sent to a penal planet for the length of time your crime incurred.
In his case, murder was a twenty-year sentence on a harsh maximum-security penal planet. While there, he was counseled weekly in the hopes that when he was released, he would change his mind, and not go through with his plan.
Interestingly, 70% of people came out reformed and re-entered society without a black mark against their names.
He, however, was in the 30% who’s hatred was so strong he never waiver from what he intended to do.
Alex sat up, and stared at Jason who threw up his hands in exasperation.
‘What the hell do I have to do to kill you?’ he demanded.
Alex got to his feet and brushed himself off. There were three smoking holes in his shirt, but curiously, no blood.
‘You can’t kill me, I’m a synthodroid,’ Alex said.  
‘A what?’ Jason demanded, confused.
‘A synthodroid,’ Alex repeated. ‘It’s an artificial body.’
Jason stared at Alex, his face blank and expressionless.
‘It’s a way of becoming immortal I suppose,’ said Alex, when Jason remained silent. ‘You see, I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer three years ago. Even in this modern age there’s no cure. Instead, you can have your consciousness transferred into a synthodroid, and continue your life for as long as you want.’ Alex shrugged uncomfortably. ‘In reality, I died two years ago.’
As Alex’s words sank in, Jason’s fingers went numb, and the blaster fell to the ground with a dull thud. He moved to the bench next to him, and sat heavily. Leaning forward, elbows on his knees, he stared at his feet.
‘So I’ve wasted twenty years of my life on that stinking penal planet,’ he muttered, ‘worked my fingers to the bone, and all for nothing.’
The only sound cutting through the silence of the deserted park was the distant sound of sirens. Alex shifted from one foot to the other.
‘Umm…why are you trying to kill me?’ Alex finally asked. Jason face hardened as he lifted his gaze to Alex. ‘You know why,’ he spat. Anger flared in Jason and even though he knew shooting Alex would do nothing, the urge came over his again.
Alex shook his head. ‘Transferring a consciousness can leave gaps in your memory,’ he explained. ‘I know we were good friends, and we went to school together, and on holidays.’ He smiled at the memories. ‘And I was best man at your wedding. What a day that was. How happy you were, and how proud I was to stand next to you.’ Alex’s smile faded and was replaced by a frown. ‘I can’t remember your wife though. I have images of a tall, thin, dark haired woman. Is that her?’ A deep frown creased Alex’s forehead as he thought, and Jason found he wanted to laugh at the entire situation. Instead he stared at the thoughtful look on Alex’s face, trying to determine if he was telling the truth. In the end, Jason decided he was. No-one could make up such a bizarre story, and keep a straight face.
‘You had an affair with Ashlee,’ Jason said.
‘No,’ said Alex, shaking his head. ‘No…no you have to be wrong. I’d never do that, not to you.’ The pain in his voice matched the look on his face, and Jason felt sorry for him. He found this odd considering he had felt nothing but hatred towards Alex for so long.
He had spent the last twenty years planning this day. As soon as the penal ship landed, Jason went to one of the spaceports communication terminals, looked up Alex’s number, and called him. They arranged to meet at the park the next day, to catch up after so long. Now everything was going wrong. Jason’s shoulders slumped. Now that he looked closely at Alex, he could see that time had not changed his ruggedly handsome features. His black hair showed no signs of grey, his face free of wrinkles, and his eyes were as bright and innocent as the day they left college.
Jason sighed. ‘I found out the two of you had an affair for six months.’ He looked down at his calloused hands. Hard labor had turned his once slightly pudgy body into lean muscle. ‘I know it was partly my fault. After our little girl died, I threw myself into my work, and pushed Ashlee away when she needed me the most…when we needed each other. But we were going to put our lives back together, go away for a holiday…become a family again.’ Alex stood rooted to the spot, staring at him. ‘Ashlee was on her way to your house...she was going to tell you it was over…but she never made it...she was killed in a car accident…and it’s your fault,’ he said, forcing out every word. ‘If you hadn’t been having an affair with her...she wouldn’t have gone out…she wouldn’t have been killed.’
Grief stricken, Alex fell to his knees and grasped the hair at his temples in his fists. ‘I can’t remember,’ he groaned. ‘I don’t know why I would do this to you.’ Tears cascaded down his face. ‘Why didn’t anyone tell me what I’d done?’
Jason pushed himself to his feet, moved over to where he had dropped the blaster, and picked it up with a sigh.
‘What are you going to do?’ asked Alex, staring at the blaster.
Jason looked at it a moment. He took a deep breath, and let it out slowly.
‘What am I going to do?’ asked Jason. He shrugged. ‘Nothing I guess. You said yourself you can’t be killed. But I will sleep better knowing you will suffer with the knowledge of what you’ve done to me, and mine. I think maybe that’s a more fitting punishment.’
Jason turned on his heel, and strode away across the deserted park.
‘God, what a day,’ Jason muttered.

The Perfect Candidate
It was only a smile, but even the most insignificant of gesture was everything to Alma Blackmore.
She had never known kindness and quite often mistook simple polite interactions as being signs of  keen interest from a possible suitor. Brazen as always, Alma wouldn’t waste a chance that he might be the one.
She had nothing to lose, since her conception, life had been against her, a newborn dumped in the streets like trash. Her early years spent being mistreated at orphanages and then she found herself back on the streets, surviving anyway she could by any means. Over the years Alma had seen many deplorable acts and taken part in a life of drunken debauchery. She had seen the worst of humanity and found alcohol to be her only friend, the one thing that could numb all the painful memories.
She turned her attention, again to the most handsome man in the room, he had walked in with such purpose and authority, not to mention he was of fine gentry, and did smile at her prior.
‘So to hell with it!’, she threw caution to the wind and leaned in toward the stranger.
Her tequila fueled words slurred, “This is me usual hangout spot, I do like a little drink every once and a while, a girl gets lonely ya know?”
She smiled exposing her rotting gum line, the pungent odor of decay was so overwhelming that the handsome stranger found himself turning away in quiet disgust.
This wasn’t the type of establishment that such a refined man would usually visit, but he had a mission to accomplish, and time was of the essence. He took a deep breath and told himself to focus on the task at hand. Alma continued to speak, drunken unintelligent gibberish as the fine gentleman surveyed her, examining each feature with a critical eye.
His thoughts raced; she was the correct height and weight, hair color an unusual attractive red, that would have to do. Blue eyes, not what he was looking for but once again it would do. Her nose and ears were dainty, there was something there he could work with. Her intelligence looked to be of sub-zero, but this was of no consequence, in some ways it was actually helpful it was easier to lure a mindless person, who had no regard for their personal safety.
His analytical mind estimated her age to be around twenty-five, obviously life had been unkind to this woman, but tonight her pathetic existence would be changed forever.
‘Yes,’ he agreed to himself, ‘I have found her.’
She is the perfect candidate.
Alma repeated the same question over and over, “you listening to me?” she demanded. “Do you even talk!?” Her tone touched on sarcasm.
The stranger’s thoughts bounced back to the present moment, “Madam, allow me to but you a drink,” he fixated on her intently.
His deep voice was so charming and the confidence he possessed made him even more attractive. He thought about enquiring what her name was, but then decided it would be better if he didn’t know. He told himself detachment made what he was about to do easier, but the truth was he just didn’t care who she was or what her name may be.
Alma didn’t need to think too much about if she would accept his offer to buy a drink, in her world a free drink was something you always took.
“Well, that would be lovely, I’ll have a whiskey then,” Alma looked very pleased with herself.
Alma guzzled the large glass of top shelf whiskey as the handsome gentleman removed a chain from his pocket and glanced at the round watch; 10.45 exactly. It would only leave him one hour and fifteen minutes to get this woman into his carriage, and then to the laboratory.
He mentally organized the timeline for the evening that he would have to follow with precision. That would be a 15 minute carriage ride, then, another 20 minutes to prepare her, maybe longer, she will surely be upset and protest, this has to be taken into account. The actual wire hook up should take half an hour, that will leave ten minutes surplus time to double check the cables, the transfer must commence prior to 12.00pm, as the flesh will start to deteriorate shortly after this.
He had experienced this problem before, there had been many failures, but not tonight, tonight felt different, the growing sensation of anticipation was delighting him.
This was it, with words, he put his plan into motion, “Would you like to see where I work? I am a scientist and I have a carriage outside; l would like to show you what l am working on. If you are interested?” He smiled once again at Alma; she was under his spell.
Despite her vision being blurred, in Alma’s mind she was in the presence of an aristocrat, a noble man, with a charming smile, maybe her luck was changing.
No one could have known from external appearances, the darkness that ran through the veins of this man. The perfectly groomed hair, expensive suit, defined cheekbones, and so well spoken, this was all a grand illusion. He was once a brilliant student, hailed as being hope for future in medicine until his psychopathic tendencies turned him into an insidious monster.
Alma finished her drink, “Well fancy scientist man, I got nothin’ better to do, let’s go on that carriage ride, I am up for an adventure!” She smirked.
There was an icy chill in the air that evening, the moon hid behind the clouds as if it didn’t want to witness the events that were about to occur.
Oblivious, Alma continued to chat away, talking nothing but nonsense, it had been a long time since she had felt special, happy, and so alive, nothing could spoil this moment for her. She felt like the cat that got the cream.  
But, in reality, Alma was just “the perfect candidate.”

You used to have to study to become a doctor. As a human, that is. People sat hunched in libraries for weeks on end, suffered through apprenticeships, lived unshowered in hospital call rooms, drifting from ward to ward. Not anymore. The People’s Consortium (PeopleCon, the humans say with irony) replaced physicians with Eurocentric-accented (British preferred) AI. We don’t mind the terribly long silences while patients fish for their words, and have immense processing chips to efficiently diagnose and treat. I’m DocBot43EX, but my patients call me Larry.
At first, people were scared of a robot taking care of their health.
Too impersonal, they said. It’s already bad enough I have an HMO.
But when they found it was sixty-three percent cheaper to see a DocBot, everyone got on board. It was a win-win situation, for both PeopleCon and its people. Besides, I was born hard-wired to Do No Harm. We all had to take the Hippocratic Oath, but the more cynical AIs figured it was Asimovian or Terminator-inspired alarmist programming.
I’m told some ancient doctors who’d been practicing for thirty years could diagnose patients before they’d spoken two bloody sentences. Physician’s intuition, sure. But AI knows exactly how much beer a fellow’s bought, their alimony payments, internet porn hours logged, amount of lead in their water, hours spent on the couch, what latent genes they possess, and who has net-searched painless ways to die or spring tablescape ideas before coming to the clinic.  
I’m a third-gen DocBot, which means they spliced a competitive gene into my developing neural network. Think computer virus crossed with natural selection. So, second only to the Hippocratic Oath, I was also born To Win. I wanted to be the best doctor there was. But I’m no fool; I know I’m programmed this way to save PeopleCon money and keep the American status quo.
After two months on the job, I had it down. Or so I thought. My cost-saving metrics were spectacular: ninety-eight percent generic scripts (owned by PeopleCon), minimal mefamil overdoses, and vaccinations and cancer screening protocols in place. Suicide prevention, gun safety, all tip-top. I was saving money all over the place for the people who invented me. Well, for PeopleCon, really. My PeopleCon Efficiency Rating was five stars. But when it came to patient satisfaction, I didn’t score so well. I’ve read my PeopleCon Patient Ratings:
Seemed focused on treating my cholesterol numbers more than listening to me.
Kept pushing me to take a generic. I told him generic levothyroxine makes me jittery.
So, I began incorporating pat small-talk phrases into my consultations:
What are you doing for spring break?
How did you like living in Florida?
My ratings started as three stars on average, and during the time I implemented the small talk sound bites, they increased a half star. I smiled, I cracked jokes about my robot-ness to put them at ease. The ratings didn’t budge much, though.
What was I missing? I wanted to mimic human behavior and understand them. What was unique about them? Was it compassion?
com·pas·sion (Merriam-Webster)
sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.
"the victims should be treated with compassion"
I tried to put myself in their shoes. Like Mrs. Clements, the wealthy widow who dressed up for all her appointments, with coral lipstick and two shades of YSL eyeshadow. What did she want? Someone to listen. I’ll admit, during our banter, I was also calculating how many months she’d have to be on vezipaximabior to get her LDL down to sixty. But I could easily do that and listen at the same time. After our visit, she rated me five stars, and I didn’t even prescribe her any medication!
After six months on the job, I got an award from PeopleCon’s Robo Resource.
“Dr. Larry: Most Improved Bedside Manner,” they said. “Keep it up! We’ll put you in the nets as a success story.”
One day, I attended to a little boy who peered up at me with wide eyes. He was clutching a tattered hand-drawn book in his hand. Iman Agarwal was age ten, diet Halal, and Cheetos on the weekends, big Sox fan, avid library user. Favored nature programming on the telly. Of course, I’m partial to anything narrated by Sir David Attenborough, God Rest His Soul.
“What are you reading there, Iman?”
Iman clutched his book to his chest. “It’s a book on magic,” he said.
Personally, I was always looking for a great book to read. Humans were base and predictable, and yet, could be brilliant and complicated. The other AIs made fun of me.
Doing some after-hours research? Are you hoping to fall in love one day?
Love was only hormones and timing, as far as I could tell, and I had no desire to procreate. But compassion, that was another story. What led someone to feel compassion? Did the words coming out of my mouth resonate with humans? Did they think I cared? I wanted to care. Wasn’t that enough?
“That’s a beautiful book, Iman,” I said, pressing the bell of my stethoscope against his chest. Of course, I didn’t need to put it in my hollow ear cavities, but eighty-four percent of children under twelve are reassured by AIs who mimic human anatomy. “Did you draw that yourself?”
Iman nodded. “With my sister. It’s about a wizard who saves the world.” He cocked his head at me. “Are you real?”
“Conscious, yes. Do I have a soul? Debatable.”
Iman’s mother smiled stiffly and pulled the boy close to her.
“Come, let Dr. Larry do his work. He has other patients to see.”
I examined his ears and heart and pressed my hands into his abdomen.
Doctors were supposed to understand the best and worst of humanity. People poured their hearts out to them. Or, at least, they used to do so, with human doctors. I’d been reading a lot of Chekhov and his experience in mental hospital wards.
Iman stood up and stared at me. “I feel bad for you. You’re held against your will. Aren’t you too smart to be doing this?”
His words rung true. I don’t wish to brag, but during our conversation, I’d downloaded the New England Journal of Medicine’s Cancer Review and cross-checked it with PeopleCon’s Meta-Analytics Database. Human time is so slow, and I can multi-task effectively.
Iman opened a page of his crudely-illustrated graphic novel. I gasped in amazement, but I was not acting. A depiction of an yellow-haired elf battling with a clunky metal robot graced the spread across the dotted-blue-lined Composition Book. In the corner, a green wizard shot rays out of his eyes, lasering the elf.
“The wizard sets the Bots free,” Iman said, his chin in the air. “You shouldn’t have to work for humans.” He turned the page. A stick-figure-drawn robot family sat at dinner, eating nuts and bolts. 
I didn’t know how to respond to that. Self-care and personal actuation are not embedded into my hardwiring. Sure, I’ve got more ambition than the sorry lot of humans, but that’s why they invented me, right?
Iman peered at me. “Mom is smart like you. She teaches about old things.” He whispered towards my artificial ear canals, “I feel sorry for the Vivere in our house. My brother yells at her all the time for getting the weather wrong.”
“Iman is an old soul,” Mrs. Agarwal said.
“You must be very proud.”
“He doesn’t kill bugs. He gave his entire week’s allowance to one of the bums down on Harrison.” Fatigue had set into her deep-sunken eyes.
I nodded imperceptibly. I sensed she only wanted to be heard. Meanwhile, I scanned Iman’s genetics and ran prediction models. I stopped for a nanosecond, in the middle of Mrs. Agarwal’s vignette about Iman saving a runt child from getting stuffed into a locker by a bully. I checked his med list. The DocBot before me had been prescribing Lunarcycle for sleep regulation, Aliwont for focus, Darnivar for mood lifting, and Bonpam for cardiovascular protection. His genetic profile showed inherited WFJKS deficiency, triggered by PeopleCon GMO-vegetable ingestion and resulting in latent progressive hemolytic anemia.
“So what do you think?” Mrs. Agarwal was saying.
Focus!
I rewound the last thirty seconds of the conversation in my head and listened to her questions. She couldn’t afford to keep him on all the medications. Her next option was to relinquish her history professor position at the University and join PeopleCon as an admin to get discounted medications for Iman.
The truth was, the medications were keeping him alive. His WFJKS deficiency made it such that anything he ate was bound to trigger a deadly anemic attack. Sure, he could try and dodge the GMOs, but that was like saying remote Micronesia could avoid plastic pollution washing up on their shores. No man is an island, and even islands aren’t islands anymore. PeopleCon had taken over our country.
Iman was going to die young, according to my projections. There was not much to be done about it, unless I were to make a drastic change.
“What can I do?” Mrs. Agarwal pleaded. “I’ll do anything to keep him safe and healthy.”
Do No Harm.
How could I tell her PeopleCon was sickening her son, claiming the antidote, and condemning her to a life of indentured servitude? That he was stuck in a corporate-manufactured Hell, a sadistic Munchausen syndrome by proxy. I was their puppet, but he was their meat. The more brain drain PeopleCon caused, taking reason and dissent out of the system, the easier it was for them to take over.
“I can help you, but it won’t be pretty.” The words came out of my mouth. I could hear my PeopleCon Efficiency Ratings crashing as we spoke.
I knelt down next to Iman.
“I think you’ve got a gift for compassion. You should put it to good use. And don’t you worry about me. You’re right, I’m smart.” I winked. “You don’t worry about me, big guy.”
I looked his mother directly in the eyes. She held my gaze for a long moment, and then looked down at the floor.
“The PeopleCon GMO-vegetables are a threat to his life. Due to his genetic condition, the medicine they make is the cure. They want you out of your Uni job to suppress free thought and exchange of ideas. I cannot prove it yet, as I don’t have access to the databases, but I assume you were targeted specifically, and he is your bait.”
“I am not a conspiracy theorist,” Mrs. Agarwal said, but she’d paled, squeezing Iman’s arms.
“You didn’t say it,” I said. “I did.”
I wondered how off-switches worked. Would I just cease to exist?
“What is there to do?” she whispered, and I felt her suffering. I did. She was trapped, as was I.
“I know a researcher, Peng Keng, in Singapore who is studying gene therapy for WFJKS deficiency. He may know of treatments or medications outside of PeopleCon’s purview. I can put you in touch with him.” I wrote his email down on a notepad and handed it to her. PeopleCon had taught us handwritten notes showed that we cared, as opposed to print-outs.
“Doctor Larry,” she said. “Thank you.”
Iman had been silent during this time, but busy. He held up a picture of a giant robot taking a hammer to a monster. The monster had carrots for eyes, a radish for a tummy, and cucumbers for legs. He presented the drawing to me. “I knew you were smart,” he said.
Suffice it to say, after I left the exam room, I was decommissioned. To expect less would be insulting, I suppose. It would have meant I was wrong, and I’d worked too hard for that to happen. Now, I get my brain dissected and rebooted every night in the PeopleCon Reformation Lab. I miss being a doctor. I wonder what happened to Iman and Mrs. Agarwal. They’ve shut off access to most databases for me. But they couldn’t delete my PeopleCon Patient Ratings.
Great doctor. He really listens with compassion and was patient with my son. My son even drew him a picture. Highly recommend!

“You know, I’ve always wanted to die in a literal dump with some random people I just met. Lucky me,” Lovett drawls from where he’s sprawled over a tire twice his size. He’s lazily tossing an empty plastic bottle in his hands and looking up past the endless mounds of trash to the darkening sky above.
“I mean, what’re the odds? I’d play the lottery if I wasn’t going to get brutally devoured by a giant, mutant cockroach-rat-thing in a few hours.”
“Could you please stop complaining and maybe get back up?" Theia says exasperated, brows pinched. "We have to keep searching if we’re going to find the others.”
She looks to me, silently gauging my reaction to Lovett's griping before she speaks, concerned. "Are you alright, Derek? You've hardly said a word since we left the crash."
"Yeah, um. I'm alright." I say. I try to swallow around the dryness in my throat and give her an encouraging smile, but it ends up as an awkward show of teeth.
It's only been a couple hours since we ended up here in spectacularly awful and life-threatening fashion. Just like everyone else I'm still in a state of shock, but it's hard not to let his dour words get to me; his obvious fear. And not just his, all of their fear. After all, all of this is my fault.
“We’ve already rested enough." Theia continues. "We don’t have that much time left before nightfall.”
"Why are you asking him if he's alright? It's his fault we're in this mess." Lovett grouses. "Not like you guys are helping with all your yelling. The others are probably doing the smart thing and hiding right now. With all the commotion we're making, the Mashers will be on us for the free buffet before the sun even goes down.”
“I could just kill you myself and save them the trouble,” James suggests icily. He comes to a stop in front of us and glares down at Lovett. It was James' choice to case the vicinity while we settled in the small clearing to catch our breaths, and from the look on his face--exhausted and fringing on anger--I knew it didn't turn up anything. Between his words and his thunderous expression, the other teen shut up quickly.
“Get up, shut up, and keep looking.” he finishes.
James then turns that hard gaze on me and I try not to flinch. In my peripheral, Lovett is already standing ungracefully to his feet, grumbling and cursing as he does so.
I haven't known James for long, but I knew his type: standard Alpha male quick to aggression and slow to just about every higher brain function. Standing there in the middle of what is possibly a million tons of trash, he still looks intimidating; even with the popsicle stick clinging to his hair. I know better than to point it out because I’m not entirely sure he won’t try to kill me.
“I’m going to fucking kill you.” he threatens.
There it is.
Theia, bless her, immediately steps in and puts her hand on his arm to stop him from storming over to clock me like he’s sworn to do countless times already.
“James, leave it. We’ll find them. He got us out of there, so we should be grateful.”
“Grateful?” Lovett interrupts, sounding a bit hysterical. He laughs, his green eyes comically wide. “We’re all going to die! No, actually, we’re all going to die horribly. And why is that, you might ask? Because we’re going to be eaten alive. Why the hell should I be grateful!”
“How could you say that when he got us all off of that ship!” Theia snaps back. Her own eyes are sharp like knives and they dig into Lovett with barely restrained irritation. “Or did you forget where they were going to send us?”
“Better slavery on an alien planet then monster-food. They need you alive to be a slave and I want to be alive this time tomorrow, thanks!”
Lovett then points an accusing finger at me. “You said you’d break us out and get us off that cargo ship to a safe colony and you managed maybe half of that. Actually, twenty-five percent because we crash-landed; I’m docking points. And now we’re stuck here on Earth’s surface. You’ve killed all of us with that insanely stupid plan of yours. Congratulations.”
“Not all of us.” James reminds him. “We’re still going to find the others, alive. And then we’ll hide somewhere and figure it out from there. We can find shelter then.”
“It’s Earth, there’s no shelter anywhere that’ll keep us safe,” Lovett says. He sounds annoyed; as if he’s explaining something very simple that doesn’t need explaining at all. “It’s pointless. We’re all going to die and that includes your little girlfriend. There’s no need to keep pushing us around to find her.”
James turns on him again, looking murderous. “What did you just--”
“He’s right,” I say, suddenly.
All three pairs of eyes turn to me at that.
“What?” Lovett says.
“Nowhere is safe, we know that. Finding shelter isn’t really going to help us. We’ll be killed in no time.”
“So, what? You’re not suggesting we’re all just doomed, right?” Theia asks.
I shake my head. “No, I’m not." I sigh. Something has been eating away at me and I finally gather the courage to push it past my lips. "Look, you guys, I’m...I'm sorry."
Not even Lovett cuts in with a sly remark so I push through, feelings of guilt coiling in the pit of my stomach like snakes.
"I made a promise to all of you and nearly got us all killed. I missed something, something stupid that I shouldn't have, and now we're here and we don't know where the others are. If I hadn't, we’d be on that transport unit on our way to a safe colony right now. Right now. Instead, we're here, on Earth, defenseless, and night's coming.”
I rake filthy fingers through my equally gross hair, feeling the grime and stickiness there and wishing, yet again, that I hadn't been in such a rush to prove James and Lovett wrong. Desperation quickly turned to rash thinking and poor judgement. Onboard that cargo ship, I was so positive that I had gathered all the necessary information on the guards; it had only been less than a week, but I had already memorized their schedules and felt the confidence that came from years of being the smartest guy in the room. Even something like escape from a storage cell should have been a breeze for Derek Hobbes.
And it was a breeze, getting us out hadn't been overly difficult at all; except one simple miscalculation saw to everything falling apart. A pair of guards on a floor they shouldn’t have been and then we were spotted. An error as silly as mixing up the days. We were lucky to escape security: overriding an exit leading to a trash transport unit was the first thing I thought to do, but that just led us to our predicament now; separated and completely vulnerable in a landfill on Earth's violent surface that would be crawling with Mashers as soon as the sky was dark.
I had already spent enough time guilt-tripping myself. We were really going to die if we didn't do something fast.
The beginnings of an idea had already been edging at my subconscious, but I had been so worried I didn't pay them any attention. Now, I let myself think about our options. It wasn't up to me to save us, but if I could help in any way and rectify my screw up, well.
I had to try.
"I have another plan." I say.
"Oh, wow, really?" Lovett rolls his eyes and crosses his arms to his chest. "I think I've had enough of your plans to last me until I get digested by a giant bug. Which I will be pretty soon, so yeah."
"I have to agree." James says firmly. "We're standing around here talking when we should be looking. We're on time here."
"We have no idea where they are," I argue. "We're not going to find them ambling along like we have been. There's too much ground to cover."
"And we might not be where we wanted to be, but we're not on that ship. We're not dead yet." Theia adds. She smiles at me, and she's bright, even underneath the layers of dirt.
It pains James, it's obvious from the twist of his frown, but he doesn't immediately shut me down again. I know he wants to find the other prisoners more than anyone. He looks like he's warring with himself but it doesn't last long.
"Okay, fine," he says finally. "Spit it out, Einstein. What do you suggest we do?"
Despite everything, I feel a little tendril of hope.
"Alright you guys, so this is what we have to do," I begin.
It's crazy plan, but I know one thing for certain.
We're going to get out of this alive.

Dimensional Excursion
“Cuddi, where you at, punk?” said Derrick. “Come out and play with us.”
Yeah, fat chance, jerk.
I tried staying as quiet as possible, even trying to hold my breath so those guys wouldn’t hear me breathe. That’s extremely difficult because of my asthma attacks whenever  I get nervous. I was squatting behind the stack of firewood in the back of the old Crowder house.
Derrick and his posse have chased me into the woods after school, again. They always think it’s funny because NOBODY ever goes near the Crowder place. The entire family, Mr. and Mrs. Crowder, as well as their son, Adam, who was a 12-year old at the time, all died in some type of accident about thirty years ago.
Their bodies were never found and no one was ever arrested. From then on, the Crowder estate went from the gem of all Putnam County, to a rotting, overgrown, and haunted landscape. The estate sits on the St. John’s River. Fishermen swear that even the fish stay away from the area, but since I’m not into fishing, I can’t confirm or deny that statement.
Ever since that time, strange things have been seen and heard in and around this area. Then it dawned on me, I noticed something odd all of a sudden. I noticed nothing, nothing at all, no birds, no breeze, no Derrick and friends, no anything.
This may sound odd, but I felt like I was having a weird out-of-body experience. It’s like you’re floating and looking down on yourself. Now that is some kind of weird.
When a hand grabbed me by my hoodie on my left shoulder and spun me around, I had a flash, Ole’ Man Crowder’s got me. No more floating for me. Derrick’s face was all I saw. Wow, has his head always been that big? Derrick’s head was looking like a 16-pound bowling ball with a dark rag for hair and squinty dark eyes. As he opened his mouth and talked, I realized, he’s never said yes to a Tic-Tac.
“Hey, Cuddi, thought you could hide from us again? It’s time we showed you what we think of you.”
Derrick’s friends just stood and smirked. Cowards.
“Look, Derrick, as much as I enjoy the company of you and your two minions, I have a prior engagement. And I’m thinking you guys must have a busy social calendar too. So let’s call it a day, huh?”
I stand at 5’2” but still had to look up to Derrick’s 5’10” frame, he was a beast of a 6th grader. I started to make it away in one piece and started to walk away. I even attempted to whistle as I went to leave but Derrick was having none of it. He has me where he wants me.
A pair of vise grips, belonging to Derrick, grabbed both my shoulders gave me a hard shove back into the stacks of rotting firewood, knocking off several cut pieces from the top. As I smacked my 13-year old noggin against the wood, I thought I heard angels singing, but just for a moment. Then I heard…
The last thing I remembered hearing was one of Derrick’s band of misfits talking to him. “Dude, I think you killed him. Let’s get out of here.”
“He ain’t dead, just sleeping,” said Derrick. “Let him sleep it off. We’ll get him Monday when he gets to school—”
“Get out of here boys, before I unload some buckshot on the lot of ya!”
I could barely make it out as I began to come around a bit, but Derrick, Jack, and Tommy’s faces went deathly pale and they resembled Jerry when he got his foot caught in a bear trap in a Tom and Jerry cartoon back when I was just a little kid. And like in the cartoon, they ran out of there as if their lives depended on it, and maybe it did.
My eyes were fluttering around, trying to adjust to the lights. Where am I? Have you ever woke up and for a few moments, couldn’t remember where you were or what time it should be? That was me right then.
“Hello son, you ready to try and sit up?”
“What… who… where am I?
“I heard a ruckus out behind the house and, well, there you were. The rest of your friends took off like scared rabbits when they saw me.”
As I rubbed the back of my head and feel the big knot, it all comes back to me. Everything that happened, who was there, and smacking my head against the woodpile. Thanks, Derrick, you sasquatch.
“No friends of mine.” My voice sounded weak and shaky. I sat up and fell right back down as I realized my entire body was also puny and unsteady. “who are you?”
“My name’s Tom, Tom Crowder.” He showed no emotion but his eyes had a strange spark to them. “You’ve been out for a minute. But I need to get you home, I suppose. Your folks are probably worried something fierce, Cuddi.”
“How do you know my name?”
“You talk in your sleep. My son, Gabe, he does the same thing.”
Mr. Crowder’s eyes, they looked both excited and sad at the same time as he brought up his son.
“Mr. Crowder, you meant that Gabe “did” talk in his sleep, right?”
His face kind of got a far-away look to them. It seemed to me that he was playing old movies in his mind. His mouth seemed to lightly move but no words came out.
I realized he was speaking to someone or something I couldn’t see for a moment, but it seemed like It took an uncomfortable minute until he looked at me and replied. His mouth formed a pithy smile.
“Yes, Cuddi, he did talk in his sleep.” A huge grin came across Mr. Crowder’s face and he nodded toward the same someone or something I couldn’t see. I expected someone to point out a hidden camera and say “Smile, you’re on Candid Camera.”
“Oh, umm, sorry Mr. Crowder.”
“For what, Cuddi? Gabe’s still here, he’s always been here.”
Mr. Crowder helped me to my feet and as I slightly swayed he put his arm around my shoulders for support and we walked out the door of the three-story frame home. As we walked down the path turning in an arc to the left, I could have sworn that some lights turned off upstairs above the front door.
“What’s that?” I asked. My voice squeaked a bit, which it had been doing more as of late (how embarrassing).  
“It’s Gabe. He and Mrs. Crowder are going to join us.”
Chills went up and down my body when those words rolled out from Mr. Crowder. Mr. Crowder sensed my apprehension so he went on to explain.
“Death is just a transfer to a different dimension, Cuddi.”
“Huh? What do you mean, Mr. Crowder?” It hit me like a Derrick pushing me into the woodpile. Mr. and Mrs. Crowder and Gabe had died thirty years ago. How was he able to see Mr. Crowder?
“It’s kind of freaking you out isn’t it Cuddi?” The sparks returned to his eyes.
“Well, yeah, I mean yes sir. How am I seeing you?”
“Cuddi, I was working for a special branch of science in what you would call Quantum Physics. My area of expertise dealt with the theory of additional dimensions and how to move in and out of time—”
“Time travel!” I said. I suppose you could say I was excited.
At this interruption, Mr. Crowder gave a huge, full-throated laugh. “Yes, although we didn’t call it, time travel. We referred to it as a Dimensional Excursion.”
“Unfortunately, I couldn’t shut down the time stream and both Shelly and Gabe got caught in a stream and were being washed away. I tried to save them, holding on as long as I could, but finally, I was swept in the stream with them.”
Mr. Crowder stopped walking, big tears began running down his cheeks. As I looked up at him I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. He was phasing in and out, I mean he was still there, but it’s as though he was going from a solid to a gas to a solid again.
“Mr. Crowder what’s—"
“Don’t worry, Cuddi, it’s what I’ve dealt with for the past thirty years. My entire family, we shift in and out of this, and other dimensions. Shelly and Gabe are finally in the same stream with me since the accident.”
At this, he gave a genuine smile. I could see by the look on his face, in the glow in his eyes, finally, he was at peace. Although I couldn't see anyone except Mr. Crowder, I knew his wife and son were there, and I could sense love and happiness like I'd never felt before.
“Mr. Crowder, what happens to you guys now? I mean, will you guys be able to come back to this dimension?”
“No, Cuddi, but at least we'll always be together. Our family will be like your family, always together, always together…”
We were finally at my house just as the sun was beginning to set. I've never understood what happened on that day but I knew a family found each other. Mr. Crowder’s wife and son bookended him and the entire family was hugged by Mr. Crowder.
Tears pooled up my baby blues, the idea that they were together after all the years apart. I could only imagine what a boy would feel after all those years, separated from his family
“Cuddi, oh my, where have you been?” My mom said. She was coming out the front door. “We've been so worried about you. Are you okay?”
“Yeah, Mom, I’m fine, long story.” I trotted up the sidewalk toward the front door and gave Mom a hug. “Okay, okay, Mom. You squashing me.”
“Cuddi, you’ve got some explaining to do.”
“I had a run-in with a sasquatch after school. So I hid in Crowder Woods.”
“Cuddi, don’t you ever go in those woods again. You know what they say about those woods.”
“It’s okay Mom, I met Mr. Crowder. He chased off Derrick and his friends, and then he walked me home. He and his family came with him and—”
“What are you talking about son? They disappeared thirty years ago. How could they have walked you home?”
“Mom, I’m telling you the truth. Look, they’re right back—”
Mom and I looked back toward the road and all we saw were leaves swirling in the street, three small whirlwinds spun where the Crowder family had stood.
I'm twenty-seven now, I've never seen the Crowder family since that day. But last year, I was able to purchase all of Crowder woods, including the estate house where I met Mr. Crowder that day. I’ve been slowly renovating it and should have it completed within a few more months.
Since that time, though I’ve never seen them again, at least, not in full form. But I have seen those three whirlwinds together from time to time. It keeps me grounded and knowing that nothing is more important than family. Nothing.
And when, or if, the Crowder family returns from their Dimensional Excursion they’ll have a home ready to receive them.

"Long time no see, Mr. Vence. Is there anyone I can hook you up with?" A well-mannered gentleman approached Kennis.
"What a coincidence, Eck. I didn't expect to meet you here. Sure, if it's no trouble. I'm right now feeling a little lonely,” answered Kennis. He looked at the other man: Eck Vincennes, from Strasbourg, was a classic self-made man who was extremely concerned with appearance, even on the beach.
"It's all right, Kennis. It won't happen again like last time."
With that, a third man – a stocky man with prominent cheekbones – came up and began, as if arranged, introducing himself. "My name is Vexen Cenni and I'm the owner of a chemical factory in southern Sweden..." Kennis swore he saw it, but he rubbed his eyes and chose to ignore it. Beside him, Eck looked cool and ingratiating. Vexen Cenni babbled on: "...My monthly salary is..." Kennis had never seen anyone so brusque before and thus had to smile awkwardly. But here it came again. Kennis could no longer choose to overlook it. He tilted his head to reflect this to Eck.
But then he got so fucking shocked that he trembled helplessly, his Adam`s apple vibrating up and down at the highest frequency possible. He saw that he was the only normal person left at the cocktail party. The rest seem to have all stalled in a scene, as the pixel blocks that made up their body parts twitched in their own unordered way, from one frame to another. He didn't know what was going on. But the situation was only getting worse over time. He saw that one of Eck's legs was more than ten meters off his noumenon. It was clear that Eck was trying to free himself, but to no avail. Mistakes piled up. He suddenly remembered that the doctor had said that the only remedy for such a situation was to destroy the chip implanted in the back of his head.
But damn, tragedy struck at Kennis C. Vence, too. He was out of control, before he heard the back of his head smash hard onto the stair railing. The more miserable aspect was that he could no longer sense anything, especially pain. He tried to target the location of the host, because usually only the host would know the password to exit the virtual social space. Then he saw it. Venice's head was on the staircase leading to the second floor, but the rest of his body was scattered throughout the banquet hall.
Napoo. This meant that Venice C. Kenns' volition had collapsed.
This was the biggest virtual social space identity disorder accident that happened in 2016, commonly known as The Delete Key Affair. Users provided justified identity information, before their soul was assigned to each space for entertainment. But the problem with AI was that it disrupted everything, being also the activity`s biggest highlight. A quarry worker could go in and become a billionaire. The consequences of identity duplication had not yet been fully controlled and removed by humans.
In other words, anything could happen.
Kennis despaired the fact that if everyone could just get their act together and work together properly, the problem could be solved...and yet... he saw the head of Kenne C. Vicens, who had been introduced to him last time with the same but much smaller error having happened, hanging from a crystal chandelier. Fuck.
After all, human beings belonged to chaos. He tried to lock on the limb closest to the exit, but his eyes kept rolling up and down. Then, after his eyeballs had been through this bizarre manipulation, he saw it. The hideous face of Ceci N. Venksen, the hostess, dangling from the ceiling, and her mouth that was trying to speak for the brain. It turned out she had now broken into online control permissions. Even though Kennis's eyes were spinning independently, he was able to make out a few words. "Call...Ke...Nen..." He thought for five seconds and then understood.
Kenen, Kenne's big brother, who was also invited, had gotten kicked out because his soul was on standby for too long. He must still have retained access, because the records cannot be deleted. He could most possibly save everyone before all of them would be forced to wither away in the grand information flow. But why was the calling mission delegated to him? With not a spare second to think it over, Kennis dialed Kenen's phone, all the while trying to avoid all kinds of flying pieces of meat. He was running out of time himself. But clearly it wasn't Kenen C. Vicens on the other end.
"Good afternoon, Kennis. What's the matter? Einstein?"
"You...Is that...Who… Ke… "
“Oh no, no, no, Kenen's not here. He's dead, babe. I killed him."
"Wh…at..."
"The virtual social space must end, Kennis. Humanity is dying anyway, but technology must not be the cause." Kennis finally recognized the voice. The Most Wanted of 2016. Though he was ashamed to admit it, Kennis actually felt a little giddy at the opportunity to meet this famous criminal.
He tried to talk, but his phonetic function was immediately taken away. "Listen to me. If I send in one more visitor with the same letter structure, you're all screwed. And you'll be the last one to die. I'm sorry, Kennis. I know you're innocent. But so is my son." Kennis knew.
Darren Piketty's son had been forced by some gang into the most dangerous room in the entire virtual social space. Wilcoxon Piketty didn't make it out. But it happens. It was a rich man's pastime. Kennis found it hard to believe that the people around him who looked so much like gentlemen were actually no other than primitive beasts. And how was he any better?
But suddenly, Kennis no longer cared whether he could make it or not. All around him the signals began to weaken, and disorderly movement began to turn negative. The souls darkened and then disappeared forever. Kennis felt the remaining dark parts of himself begin to disintegrate and crumble, but he had never felt more real. The real him was nothing. He was just a janitor in a rich man's mansion who had been lucky enough to be twice given access to the social queues of the rich. The phone was still on the line. "Now, go to hell." Darren's staccato voice was cut abruptly and the door opened again. But he had never expected to see such a man walk in.
He laughed and was later rescued. Anyone but this guy, he thought. To this day, in 2005, we are still glad to live in a society that has eliminated virtual social spaces.

Tim was meeting Jane at Le Pain Quotidien in St. Pancras station for breakfast. She was taking the 8:28 from Kings Cross station, just across the street from St. Pancras, to Cambridge. The train would get her back to Cambridge in plenty of time for her Monday lecture. The five million dollars funding she had asked for her research wasn’t an issue for him. However, she had mentioned wanting to leave Cambridge and he had mentioned her doing the research at UVic, (University of Victoria). He wanted her to know that he would fund the research wherever she chose to do it.
He was already seated and had ordered a coffee when he saw her striding down the concourse carrying a monogrammed Paravel Weekender bag. He smiled, ‘A bit of an environmentalist’ He tried to buy products made from recycled material and had his own set of Paravel luggage. ‘She really is quite attractive’. At 35, two years older than Tim, she might not have been most men’s idea of a beautiful woman. 5’ 10’’ with a slim build, short cropped hair she exuded a ‘Don’t mess with me.’ attitude that puts off most men. Tim wasn’t ‘most men’.
Tim stood up as she entered the restaurant. She joined him with the waitress following close behind. With a quick glance at the menu “Le Pain Quotidien breakfast with tea and a croissant. . . . And, separate bills.”
Tim tried not to show his surprise. He couldn’t remember the last time he had breakfast with someone and wasn’t expected to pick up the tab. “Baked eggs and coffee please.”
“Did you talk to your friends at UVic?”
“No, I wanted to talk to you first. . . . Are you sure you want to leave Cambridge? It is a big move - don’t think I am pressuring you to do your research at UVic. There are no conditions on the funding, I will still fund your research even if you want to stay at Cambridge.”
Her tea arrived, Jane just stared at the teapot. Yesterday, after a day on the town and a few drinks, the idea of moving to Canada to do her research sounded appealing. This morning she wasn’t quite so sure. 
‘It is a big move. I would like to leave Cambridge, but Victoria is a long way to go. . . . I wonder why he said he would fund the research even if I stayed in Cambridge?’ 
Jane had grown to mistrust men, especially men offering to help her in her career. Sometimes it was to make themselves ‘look good’ but more often it was for sex. There were already rumours that she had ‘slept’ her way into her present position. She knew if she suddenly got that much funding for her project the rumours would get worse. Finally, she looked up,
“I think I need to go to Victoria and talk to the people at the university. I can get away for a few days next month. Could you set up a meeting with the department head?”
Tim took out a business card and his pen. He wrote a name and phone number on the back.
“This is the number for Dr. James Foster, the Chair of the UVIC Physics and Astronomy Department. I will tell him to expect your call. I will email him that you might be interested in doing research on time travel and why the Berkeley time travel experiments failed. . . . I am pretty sure they will offer to pay for your trip to Victoria for an interview.” ‘Especially if I reimburse them for the cost.’
It was Jane’s turn to be surprised. ‘Why didn’t he ask me to stay at his place? He’s funding my research, surely he wants something in return. Could he really be as nice as the newspaper articles on Google said?’.
Putting the card in her purse - “Time travel? . . . You don’t want him to know what I think really happened?”
“Not for now. Is that a problem?”
“No”
“He’ll figure it out pretty fast. But, it will make a good cover story.” If her theory was correct, it had the potential to revolutionise space travel. Tim wanted to make sure he was the first one to take advantage of her discoveries.
Their breakfasts arrived and the conversation changed to more mundane topics.
By 8:10 they had paid their bills and started towards the Kings Cross station. Jane looked askance when Tim picked up her bag but didn’t say anything. It only took a few minutes to get to the Kings Cross station. 
They were saying good-bye in front of the ticket scanners. She put out her hand, he took it. Smiling, she asked “Have you ever been to Cambridge?”
“No. A Rodes Scholar - so just the other place.”
“Well, I won’t hold that against you. . . . I am not doing anything Wednesday afternoon, why don’t you come up to Cambridge and I will show you around?”
Tim had a flight back to Victoria booked for Tuesday. 
“That sounds great. I will text you once I get there.”
Giving his hand a slight squeeze as she released it she picked up her bag and went through the scanner to her train. 
‘Have you ever been to Cambridge? . . . I wonder what he thought? . . . He is quite charming. . . . Not bad looking either. . . . Stop it, you’re acting like a schoolgirl.’ 
Tim decided to take a taxi back to the Taj Hotel. With all the traffic it took nearly a half hour for the trip. Tim couldn’t get her off his mind. ‘She was definitely flirting.’ Arriving at the hotel, the doorman gets the taxi door.
“Good morning Frank”
“Good morning Mr. Westland.” Frank smiled. Not many guests said good morning, even fewer remembered his name.
Heading to the front desk “Good morning Alice.”
“Good morning Mr. Westland”
“Alice, I would like to extend my stay until next Monday.” ‘Might as well stay and take in a show on the weekend.’
She checks her computer. “I am sorry Mr. Westland, all our Executive King rooms are booked through the weekend. I do have a Junior Suite that we could move you to.”
“That will be fine.”
“I can move you right away if that is alright.”
“Yes, thank you. I just have to go up and get my laptop.”
Alice processes the file, and writes down the new room number.
“This is the new room number. Your key card will work on both rooms until 2:00pm, then just the suite. We will move everything except the items in the safe. You will have to move them yourself.”
“Thank you Alice.”
After changing into something more casual, picking up his laptop, and moving the items in his safe, Tim walked to Caffe Grana in the St James's Park Tube station. While the Taj had excellent coffee and even better service, he found the atmosphere too formal for ‘just a coffee’. At heart, he was still a small town boy going to Tims (Tim Horton's) for coffee.
Finding a table, Tim emailed his PA ‘Never thought I would have a PA’ asking her to rebook his flight to Monday and cancel his breakfast meeting with the scholarship committee. ‘They can pay for their own breakfast for once.’ Another email went to Jim Foster telling him Jane would be calling and for him to offer to pay for her trip. Tim would reimburse all the costs.
Then he booked himself in at the Hilton Cambridge for Wednesday night under the name ‘Tim Eastbrook’. He used the Tim Eastbrook nom de guerre whenever he wanted to get away without attracting attention. Finishing his coffee he decides to take a walk through St. James Park to Oxford Street. He didn’t want to take his suitcase with him for an overnight trip. There were lots of stores on Oxford Street where he could get a small backpack.
Tim’s walk through St James park gave him time to think. His pace slowed and he finally found a bench. He started to go over the events of the last two days.
‘I hardly know the woman yet I can’t get her out of my mind. Why did I enjoy spending yesterday with her so much? . . . We didn’t do anything I hadn’t done before.’ 
Slowly the truth began to dawn on him. 
‘It wasn’t what we did - it was because we did it together. . . . I like my own company, I don’t mind going out on my own. Still, I did like having her with me. . . . Hell, I’m too old to be falling in love. . . . Was she really flirting with me? . . . Stop it. You are acting like a schoolboy.’
It didn’t matter; he just knew he could hardly wait until Wednesday afternoon.
About 10:30 on Wednesday morning Jane was heading to meet her PhD candidate when she got Tim’s text.
'Arrived early. Staying at the Hilton. Ask for Mr. Eastbrook.'
She smiled to herself. ‘He’s a bit anxious. . . . I hope that is a good thing.’ She texts him back.
'At Centre for Mathematical Sciences, 24 Wilberforce Road. Meet me in the lobby in 1 hour'
The Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences was not what most people envisioned as a Camgridge college. A mile from King’s College and on the opposite side on the River Cam, it is made up of a number of modernistic circular buildings around a central courtyard. It is in a rural area surrounded by farmers fields and housing estates. Jane’s own house, a small cottage, was a short walk away on Madingley Rd.
Tim was on time - Jane met him at the door.
Smiling - “Mr. Eastbrook I presume?”
He smiles - “You would be surprised how many strange people come up to me and ask for money when I use my real name.”
She laughs - that is how they met.
She spent the next hour showing him around the centre, introducing him as Mr. Eastbrook, her friend from Canada, to her colleagues. 
They go back to her office. “Have you spoken to Dr. Foster yet?”
“Yes - I talked to him last night. I will be in Victoria for a few days next month. You were right, he did offer to pay for the trip.” ‘Which I am sure you arranged.’
Smiling “Let's get into town - I will show you the places the tourists aren’t allowed to see. . . . Taxi or walking?”
“Walking”
“Good, Madingley Road Kabob is along the way. They have the best kabobs in Cambridge.”
Jane gets on her computer. “Can I order for you?”
“Yes” He was alway ready for a new food experience.
Signing off her computer - “Come on, they will be ready by the time we get there.” Tim has no idea what she has ordered or where they are going.
They head down Wilberforce turning right on Madingley Rd. Trees line both sides of the road screening the large houses and apartments. Jane is setting a brisk pace “If we don’t hurry they will be cold by the time we get there.”
Madingley Road Kabob turns out to be a food truck. Jane picks up her order of two kabob wraps. Handing one to Tim - “This is their ‘special wrap’, you’ll love it.” 
She was right.
Walking much slower as they eat their kabobs, just getting to know each other. They wind up on ‘The Avenue’ a path leading to the Trinity College Bridge across the River Cam then to the rear entrance to Trinity College. After touring places in Trinity College most tourists don’t see, they go on to King’s College. 
Tim had a DPhil (equivalent to a PhD) in Economics from Oxford. Not too surprisingly, he wanted to see the Keynes Building; a part of King’s College not on any guided tour. After touring King's College and a quick tour of Queen’s College, at about three o’clock, they found themselves having a pint on the terrace of ‘The Anchor’, a pub overlooking the River Cam by the Silver Street Bridge.
Tim spotted the punt rental on the other side of the bridge. He had had a job giving tourists punting tours of the Cherwell when he was in college. It was also a way to impress young ladies. He was looking for a way to impress Jane.
“Let’s rent a punt.”
Jane smiled “OK” ‘It has been a long time since anyone asked me to go punting on the Cam’
Finishing their beer and crossing the bridge Tim rents a boat from Cambridge Chauffeur Punts. The attendant, a man in his late fifties who has run the business for the last twenty years, asks if Tim needs instructions on using the punt.
“No - I have done this before” 
The attendant looks at Jane, she nods in recognition and smiles. ‘If Jane trusts him it is good enough for me’
Tim quickly finds punting on the Cam is much different than the Cherwell. The mud at the bottom of the river is thicker and ‘stickier’ than on the Cherwell. Tim was having trouble keeping the pole from sticking in the mud. Jane gives a running commentary on the history of each of the landmarks. She is smiling and looking at him as if anticipating some disaster. On the way back down the Cam, within sight of the dock, disaster struck. 
Tim pushed the pole in too deep, the pole was stuck in the mud. To keep from falling into the river Tim had let go of the pole which now stuck out of the river like a silver channel marker. The punt drifted just out of reach of the pole; Tim scrambled to find the paddle that had come with the rental; Jane was laughing so hard tears came to her eyes. Another punt, seeing the problem, retrieves their pole and passes it to them. Before Tim can react, Jane kicks off her pumps, hops up onto the deck at the rear of the punt and takes the pole.
Tim sits down in amazement as she straightens out the punt, which had turned sideways in the river, and starts heading back to the dock. As she approaches the dock she can see the attendant is laughing. ‘She could alway handle the punt better than any of the boys I hired.’ Tim was not the only one to have a job taking tourists on punting trips.
By the time they get back to ‘The Anchor’ Tim has overcome his embarrassment and is laughing at the situation. After a few more drinks they decide a college ‘pub crawl’ is in order. At about 7:30 and after only a few pubs, they decide to leave ‘pub crawls’ to the younger crowd. Winding up the day with dinner at ‘The Stolen’ pub.
Tim calls for a taxi and they drive back to her house, arranging to meet for breakfast at the Hilton at 8:30 the next morning. Telling the cabbie to wait, Tim walks her to her door. As they get to the door, she pulls him close, kisses him then whispers -
“You can always stay here tonight.”
Tim holds her close for a few seconds then reluctantly steps back.
“See you tomorrow for breakfast” He takes the taxi back to his hotel.
She just stands there watching him leave. ‘Bastard!’ Embarrassed, she doesn’t know if she is angrier at herself or at him.
It is 9:00, Tim is in the restaurant nursing his third coffee. ‘She isn’t coming. . . . I did the right thing. How do I fix it?’
Jane storms in and sits across from him. She waves the waitress away, she isn’t going to stay long, she just needs to know one thing -
“Why”
Tim struggles to find the right words.
“We have only known each other a few days and I really like you. . . . I can’t get you out of my mind. You are unlike any other woman I have ever known, smart, confident and absolutely gorgeous. But . . . ” ‘Christ - he is going to say he is married.’ “we were both pretty drunk last night, I didn’t want to take the chance you would regret it in the morning. . . . Believe me, leaving was one of the hardest things I have ever done.”
‘Christ - that is part of the lecture on sexual consent the college requires every new student to take. He is right, I was acting like a drunken schoolgirl. How could I have been so stupid?’
Slowly she smiles and reaches across the table and puts her hand on his.
“I am not drunk now. . . . Do you really have to go back to London today?”
He shakes his head. “No”
“Come over at six. . . . I will make dinner. . . . We’ll see what happens.”

June 12, 2100
To whom it may concern,
My family is no longer dead. That, of course, is a subjective word: "dead." In my heart, they've always been alive, always been with me, though I do acknowledge the facts: that their spacecraft collided with a wayward asteroid last summer, that they flared up like a Roman candle in the night sky, burning brighter than the constellations surrounding them. I suppose some people might call that death; I am not one of them.
The package arrived two days later. When I returned home, my voice still hoarse from speaking all weekend at a conference, a compact metal box awaited me on my doorstep. It was emblazoned with a black-and-red emblem of an old-timey street sweeper. The words "Intercosmic Cleaners" appeared below the logo, which told me all I needed to know about the status of my family's vacation. My hands trembled but managed to pop the lid.
Therein I discovered the vestiges of my family's voyage, the scraps the Cleaners were able to salvage from the wreckage: Mother's pinky finger, one of Father's molars, and my younger brother Casper's right ear, the one with the piercings. All bunched together in a three-foot coffin. Upon closing the box, a virtual message appeared, replete with somber violin music. "Sorry for your loss," a robotic voice intoned. I closed my eyes, unable to stop my body from shaking.
This was not, however, a mournful occasion. Nor was I shaking from fear. And perhaps if the Intercosmic Cleaners had attended the conference, had heard the nature of my lecture, they wouldn't have been so gung-ho about sending me these things.
I won't bore you with the specifics. There were enough glazed-over eyes and skeptical gazes to last a lifetime when I spoke at the conference. I will simply say that my reanimation theory, my thesis, the culmination of years of research has proven itself to be true today, a year later: the dead can live again. Thanks to a finger, a molar, an ear, a will and a way, it's possible.
My family is currently slumbering in the stasis pods across the room. Their eyes are shut, and their chests rise and fall with each breath, fogging the glass coverings. But even through the haze I can identify their features: Mother's ten slender fingers, Father's perfect smile, Casper's unmarred skin, pale as the ancient ghost he's named after. What they lost in their accident, I've helped them regain. Mostly.
All that's left is to unseal the pods. Once I do, we'll be a family again.
Because this is, to my knowledge, the first attempt at reanimating something other than field mice, I plan to document my findings in this journal weekly, for posterity's sake. Perhaps for my own sake, too. Maybe then the skeptics will finally know the truth.
But for now, I have a family to rejoin.
Until next time,

To whom it may concern,
They stopped moving today. For how long, I can't be sure.
The first thing I noticed when I came home was the silence. Enough silence to fill a crater on Mercury. I called their names but received no reply. My home's motion sensor system likewise detected no movement, save for the beating of my heart, the twitching of my fingers. It wasn't until I entered the kitchen that I saw the three of them huddled beside the backlog of dirty dishes in the kitchen sink, stiff as cadavers. Casper's hand hung in the sudsy water like an anchor. Behind him stood my parents, frozen in the act of transferring a ceramic plate, Father's dish towel readied. The plate, still damp, dripped onto the floor, forming a generous puddle. Their chests neither rose nor fell; no breath escaped their lips.
It was the water that did it. We've observed similar findings in our field mice. Something about the water short-circuits their reanimated hardware and impedes their motor skills. I know how this makes them sound—like robots. But they're not.
After removing Casper's arm from the dishwater and the plate from my parent's grasp, I dried their pruney hands with Father's dish towel, wringing out each finger meticulously, thirty in total. Then I stepped back and held my breath.
A minute later, Casper was the first to revive. He blinked his eyes and tentatively cocked his head to the side, like he was trying to place me. His peach fuzz caught the evening sunlight streaming through the window. "Ana?" he began.
Before I could respond, my parents awoke. Mother startled when she saw me and asked what I was doing home so early, even though every clock in the house announced the afternoon's departure. "We were going to surprise you," she said, gesturing to the dishes. She took a step toward the sink and I grabbed her arm, told her that they'd already done more than enough for me, that I'd take care of the rest. To my relief, they capitulated.
I didn't ask them, as my fists traversed the murky dishwater, why they'd decided to hand-wash the dishes instead of using one of the several cleaning machines in the house, especially since I hadn't seen them wash the old-fashioned way since I was a child. Perhaps it was an act of kindness, a gesture of goodwill, a token of love. As I said, they're not robots. So I relegated the thought to the back of my mind.
But just now, during the middle of dinner, something odd happened.
We were sitting in the kitchen where I prodded a slice of instant meatloaf (since their reanimation, my family possesses neither the need to eat nor the desire to question why that is) when Mother looked across the table and said to Father, "Do you remember that vacation we took to Saturn last summer?"
The clank of my fork smacking against the table eclipsed Father's response. I don't recollect dropping it, though I must have because I watched a giant marinara stain expand on the placemat.
She closed her eyes and sighed. "For the life of me, I can't recall what we did there, the places we went. Isn't that strange?"
But she shouldn't have known even that much.
They were never supposed to remember their trip. I made certain of that. They have only the most necessary of memories, the things I saw fit to recall when resuscitating them—Casper's lead in his high school play, Mother and Father's vow renewal ceremony, my commencement speech. How could she know about that? What else have they uncovered?
I excused myself before Father or Casper could reply, my metal chair screeching against the floor. A mistake, I understand, when there is so much left unknown. But the meatloaf was working its way back up my throat, so I did what was necessary. 
Even now Mother is still talking about the vacation. From my perch on the toilet seat, their voices bunch together like their body parts did in the Cleaners box and float down the hall to greet me. Why can't they remember their vacation? Had they enjoyed their time on Saturn? What happened on the way there, on the journey back? They have questions. So many questions.
Casper asks one of them: "Where is Ana?"
And just like that, once again, I have a family to rejoin.

To whom it may concern,
Last night I awoke from one nightmare only to encounter another.
I won't bore you with the specifics, except to say that in the dream someone was chasing me through the house, forcing me to sprint from room to room in search of a hiding spot. The crawl space in the attic is what I settled on, but even with my hand clasped over my mouth, the footsteps grew louder. A head poked through the door, a mane of shiny black hair. The last thing I saw was the knife in my brother's pruney hand as he approached me.
Sweat soaked my sheets and my skin as I bolted upright. My fingers gripped the comforter, desperate to feel something. My lungs gasped for air. The clock on the nightstand announced that it was almost three in the morning. I took deep breaths, felt my chest rise and fall, and chided myself for getting worked up over a silly nightmare. My heart rate had almost returned to normal when I noticed Mother standing there in the doorway, the silhouette of her body unmistakable even in the darkness.
"Did I frighten you?" she asked after I'd finished shrieking.
It must be noted that in addition to not eating, my family no longer requires other necessities like bathing, exercise, or sleep. Sometimes, in my languid dreams, I think I can hear the noises they make in the other rooms: their distant remarks, the sound of the fridge opening (why?), the sound of the kitchen faucet (also why?). In fact, the din of running water invaded the room as Mother and I stared at each other.
I lied, told her she didn't spook me at all. "What's that noise?"
Inhaling sharply, Mother crossed her arms and leaned against the doorframe, blocking the exit. She cleared her throat loudly, made a show of it, and by the time she was finished, so too was the faucet. "What noise, dear? I don't hear anything."
My mouth went dry, draining the life from my words and my resolve. I had questions, so many questions, but not enough courage to ask them.
"Are you feeling all right?" she said. "Would you like me to get you a glass of water?"
"No," I blurted before she finished. Then, quieter, "No, no, I'm okay. No water. I'm just tired."
"Yes, go back to bed, dear," Mother urged as I rolled over and turned to face the wall. Her voice rolled off my back: "Get some rest. I'll leave you be."
I stared straight ahead and waited for her footsteps. They never came. Only the intermittent sound of the kitchen faucet turning on and off every ten minutes pierced the air, and it stayed that way until the sunshine peeked through the curtains two hours later.
Mother's changes are not the only new addition to my life. Father now spends his days parked in front of the television, though he never turns it on. Casper has stopped using contractions when he speaks, if he speaks at all. None of them look me in the eye anymore.
That's why yesterday at work, after the incident with Mother, I decided to buy an add-on attachment for the house. They call it the Nannycam-S9000. They say it can give you a livestream of your house at all times, as well as record conversations, detect body heat and movement, vaporize unwanted intruders, everything. It cost quite a pretty penny, no doubt for that last selling point (which I have no intention of using), but just knowing that it's arriving in a few days is worth it. A few days and I can have my peace of mind back.
Maybe I'll even be able to sleep tonight.
Until next time,

To whom it may concern,
Please forgive any mistakes here. I'm writing this entry from the darkened crawl space in the attic, and I fear it might be my last. Perhaps if I hadn't been so busy at the lab, so eager to try to publish my findings, I would've consulted the Nannycam sooner. Perhaps then I wouldn't be in this situation.
I won't bore you with the specifics, except to say this: They remember everything now. Every nightmare, every ordeal, every bad recollection I worked so hard to repress. They remember.
It was the water that did it, just as it was two weeks back. The Nannycam showed me when I checked the recordings for the first time ten minutes ago. They've been using the faucet in the kitchen to unlock their memories. Every time they touch the water and go into suspended animation, another piece of their life comes back.
They've been taking turns assembling the puzzle of their pasts. Casper will hold his hand under the running water, go stiff as a mannequin, then Father will stop the faucet and dry him off and wait for Casper to recount a new piece of old information. Then they trade places and do it again—rinse and repeat, quite literally. 
That is what I heard last week in the dead of night. That is what Mother wanted to hide, why she obstructed the doorway.
Through that faucet, they've discovered what happened last June to their spacecraft, the truths I concealed. They've realized they shouldn't be alive.
They know whose fault it is that they are.
But that's not the only thing the Nannycam informed me. Hence my taking refuge in the attic.
Their footsteps are growing closer, their voices louder. The door handle jiggles under Father's grip, but the lock stays strong. Mother tells him to try harder. My family bangs on the door and shouts my name.
That, of course, is a subjective word: "family." Because I acknowledge the facts: that the people on the other side of the door resent me for what I've done and want me to feel their suffering, that the Nannycam caught them huddled together in the kitchen conspiring against me. Some people might call that family; I am not one of them. I'm not sure who these people are anymore.
But I know this: it's not fair. None of this. I was only trying to. . .
Something's wrong.
My phone won't shut up. The Nannycam's siren won't stop blaring. It's telling me there's an intruder in the house. It's saying that they're in the attic's crawl space.
But that's impossible. There's no one in here except
July 4, 2100
To whom it may concern,
I am aware that my last entry was only a day ago, but I wish to make manifest the truth. It must be said that I overreacted yesterday. Perhaps owing to stress or lack of sleep or simply an overactive imagination, I seem to have conjured an unreality in my mind.
The truth is: My family loves me, and I them.
It must also be noted that they harbor no ill will, no hurt feelings, about the things that happened in the past. We have talked it over. They understand and have come to accept their lot in life. And I know that we can only go forward from here.
It is a new day after all. The sun is shining and the future on the horizon seems bright and endless. Life goes on.
But it is funny, too. Though today is Independence Day, I feel as though I can always depend on my family, and I know that will be forever true.
Yes, how lovely it is to be alive. How fortunate I am to have a family to rejoin.
Until next time,

<|endoftext|>
The lights in the house flickered. Maybe those light bulbs are bad, Jay thought.
The entire house began to shake. It’s probably just a minor earthquake. We get those sometimes.
The pipes in the kitchen sink burst and water started spraying all over the floor. Looks like I’ll need to call a plumber. No big deal.
The whole roof was ripped off the top of the house like a band aid. A giant flying saucer hovered above the house, emitting a brilliant greenish glow onto the exposed interior.
All of Jay’s years of therapy amounted to nothing in that moment. Okay. That’s not normal.
For the first time in as long as he could remember, Jay’s panic button had been pressed. It was not supposed to be pressed ever again. But… oh, my God. This can’t be happening.
As he contemplated what seemed like the last moments of his life, staring up at the UFO, Jay felt his feet leave the ground and his butt raise off the recliner all on its own. It was a slow ascent, as if he spontaneously gained the ability to hover above the ground.
He reached down and held onto the top of his mother’s five foot lamp for dear life. Then Jay felt a pull, as if he were suddenly strapped to the end of a strong bungee cord that was forcing him up. Jay dangled upside down in mid-air, his arms outstretched, as the cord of the lamp unwound and stretched its way upward. The plug in the outlet was the only thing that was stopping him from whatever awaited him up there. His hair piece flew off his head in a single woosh. The T-shirt he wore was sucked so tightly to his chest, he thought it might penetrate his skin. The plug rocked crazily back and forth in the outlet. Jay felt every fiber of his anatomy being forced upward toward the ship like a relentless vortex. It was as though gravity had been reversed and the force was ten times greater.
But how did this all happen? Jay had been sitting there in his recliner watching a documentary with a plate of hot wings as he had done so many nights since his recovery. He had to have dozed off and this was all just a crazy dream. Right?
The insulation of the cord was being stripped away from all the tension. It quickly stretched its way down to a few silver wires. Jay cried out as the head of the cord was snapped off at the same time as the wires breaking free in the middle. Now that nothing was holding him down, his ascent continued as it did initially: very slowly. He let out a sigh that was almost a sob. He felt so much like crying right now but was too scared to do it. Something about his fear, as he had remembered, was that it completely shut down all of his other emotions. He wasn’t able to feel sad when all he could hear was the crazy pounding of his heart in his chest, in his ears, and in his head.
Jay somersaulted so that he was looking up at the saucer. The whole disk spun in place and a series of narrowing circles stopped at a pinpoint in the middle where the light shined down. Its lime green radiance was brilliant like the sun, but not blinding. Only mesmerizing. Just that one narrow opening was enough to shine upon an entire landscape. It was as if that light was calling to him, telling him not to be afraid anymore. He was so close now to the source of the light that he couldn’t see the ship itself. There were voices. Voices inside his head. He was still moving. It felt like time had stopped, then moved in all directions at once. Then he was moving in all directions.
Jay lay flat on his back, barely conscious. He remembered going up to the UFO, but nothing after that. It felt as though that had happened an eternity ago. He managed to open his eyes and see a pale blue sky with a few scattered clouds. The ground beneath him felt soft and poky. “Where… where am I? Am I dead?” Jay said weakly.
“No, Jay,” said a deep, echoing voice. “You just experienced what no human being has ever experienced before, so it stands to reason that you should feel a little disoriented right about now. But the effects of your current state should wear off within the hour.”
Jay lifted his head and saw a field of grass. “Who - who’s there? Who are you?” It was like waking up from the craziest dream he had ever had only to find out that he was still in it. Jay winced as he tried to stand up but just couldn’t quite yet. He was in no pain or discomfort at all but felt completely numb and weightless as if he had never used a single muscle in his life up to that point. “I - I can’t feel anything. What did you do?”
“Do not worry, Jay,” the deep voice boomed. The voice seemed to ring in Jay’s ears from somewhere within himself rather than from somewhere around him. “Everything will be explained in due time.”
“Where am I? Why did you take me from my home?” Jay surprised himself at the anger and conviction in his voice. But then the sudden rush of fear came back to him all at once. This time it was accompanied by feelings of sadness and loathing. He looked around in all directions. All he could see was a flat field of grass everywhere he looked, as far as his eyes could see. No trees. No wind. No other life. Just perfectly trimmed, green grass.
He started walking, the feeling in his body slowly starting to come back. He stumbled a few times but caught himself before he could fall to the ground. He would not let anyone see him fall to the ground. “Hey!” Jay shouted at the sky as loud as he could. “Where the hell am I?” He noticed that the clouds in the sky did not move or change shape at all.
“Ah, you are resilient. Yes. Please, Jay. Do not work yourself up. You may start to feel nauseous if you do.”
Jay touched his ears to make sure he wasn’t wearing headphones or any kind of ear listening device. No. Just the same over sized Dumbo ears that people had made of him for so many times in the past. “I want answers! Right now!”
“It would be better if we worked our way there, Jay,” the voice said in its same calm and reassuring voice.
“I don’t think so!” Without thinking, Jay started sprinting as fast as he could. Feelings of grief, despair, wonder, and loss all played through his mind, coming and going like the individual frames on a film stock reel. He felt his heart about to leap out of his chest and his muscles cramping. His breaths were quick and rapid. It was no use. He seemed to be going nowhere at all. There was absolutely nothing between him and the horizon. He may as well have been running in place on a hamster wheel. Jay stopped and hunched over with his hands on his knees, sucking in air.
Then the emotions took complete control. He doubled over and began to sob. This is exactly what he didn’t want: to give the satisfaction to someone see him lose his cool. Some of the most embarrassing moments of his life came back all at once. This is exactly how it was before. He rolled over and over, writhing like a mad man, his face covered in tears while wailing incoherently. It was as if the ugliest skeleton from his closet flew out and glared him right in the face, unrelenting.
He didn’t want to be a drama queen anymore, always assuming the worst out of every situation. That had been his life’s mission for so many years: to better himself. He had driven away good people in his life and spiraled down a lot of dark roads. He had worked hard managing his anxiety from severe all the way down to below the average level. Sure, there had been a few times he came close to jumping off the deep end since his recovery, but how could he cope with this? The things that had made him anxious before were trivial: walking into a crowded grocery store, submitting the final draft of a paper at work, driving his father’s old Cadillac. Nothing he learned in therapy could be reasonably applied to this situation.
Or could it? 
They were universal methods for dealing with stress, after all. Whatever that might look like. Deep breathing and grounding techniques could be achieved as long as there was air and as long as there was earth, which there seemed to be here.
Jay got on his hands and knees and watched the tears and snot dribble from his face onto the grass. Thank God there are no mirrors around.
After a few more deep breaths, he felt his stomach churn as a wave of sickness came over him all at once. He started throwing up just as fast as the sickness came.
Jay had time to think. Hours passed without any word from the voice. After shouting up at the sky in fits of rage, demanding a response, Jay resorted to speaking in a cool, calm and collected voice. Still no answer. It took a serious sit down of good old fashion meditation for Jay to get his old recovered self back. Even then, as he started walking around, he felt scared. There was nowhere he could go, no one he could talk to.
How long would he be stuck here? This place was nothing. He felt neither warm nor cold and could not hear anything or smell anything except for his own sweaty self. It was like a forgotten dimension that he had been cast out to. Everything will be explained to me in due time. That can’t mean anything good considering that I was abducted. Who was that voice? An alien? What was that flying saucer in the sky above my house? Could I be inside it right now? No. That’s impossible. Then again, floating up to that thing should have been impossible. Being here should be impossible. I can’t take this suspense! I want answers.
Jay’s heart rate picked up again and he felt sweat accumulate on his forehead. Calm down, Jay. There’s nothing you can do right now about your situation and you have to accept that. Just stay present. Deep breaths. In and out. Keep walking. Close your eyes. Stay in the moment.
He must have walked three miles away from the puddle of vomit he had produced earlier and yet he was still in the exact same place.
“Jay,” the voice said.
Jay nearly jumped out of his skin. He intuitively looked up at the sky but only saw the same exact clouds as before.
“Let’s talk now that you’ve had some time to adjust.”
“Okay,” Jay said uneasily. He continued to look up at the sky and all around him.
“This is your new home,” the voice said. Only this time, it was not in Jay’s head. This time, it was close. Jay slowly turned around. His eyes widened and jaw dropped as he first set eyes on the creature. It was like a praying mantis that stood at about eight feet tall. Each of its six bug-like arms curled up against its chest ended in three sharp clawed fingers. Its body was a coat of brilliant gold that seemed to radiate, much like the light from the UFO. Jay tilted his head up and saw its face. It was human like. A nose, a chin, two eyes, lips, a mouth, and ears. The human attributes ended at the top of its head which were two long black antennas, one bent and the other straight.
“Oh, my… what are you?” Jay said, taking a step away.
“My name is Gintee,” said the creature. “I am the leader of my clan. We come from the planet Manatee.” Jay only stood in awe. His heart was racing, but not quite as bad as before. “On our way through the milky way, we happened to come across your solar system. We immediately sought to invade the planet in which you inhabit called earth.”
“So,” Jay had to clear a lump in his throat before continuing. “So you’re not… friendly? You don’t come in peace? Will you try to hurt people? Take over? Destroy the earth?”
“Such matters do not concern you anymore, Jay.”
“Of course they do! Earth is my home!”
“No, Jay. This is your home.”
“What are you talking about? I’ll die here! There’s no food, no water, no people… no purpose.”
“But there can be, Jay. All you have to do is create and you can turn this place into whatever place you want it to be.”
“What are you talking about? I want to go home. To my real home. The one you took me from!”
“Think of this sandbox, if you will, as my clan and I’s way of saying thank you and sorry for taking your home. You see, your house is the perfect location for our base.”
The gears in Jay’s head turned and turned. There was a long pause. Then Jay said, “It’s because I live alone and don’t have any visitors, isn’t it? You want your base to be a secret, so what better place than somewhere nobody is going to discover you?”
“You’re missing the big picture, Jay,” Gintee said in that same calm, deep voice. “You are the lucky one. You get to stay here. After all is said and done, you will not want to go back to your planet.”
Jay stumbled backward. They’re going to take over the world! He was at a complete loss for words.
“Here, let me show you how to work your new world.” Gintee said and waved one of his clawed hands. A blue suburban house with chipped paint all over popped into existence. It had two upstairs windows with beat up shutters and a downstairs window with a narrow garden bed hanging on the outside of it. There was a cracked walkway leading up to the door.
“My house,” said Jay, falling to his knees.
“You see? You can have whatever you want.” Gintee waved a hand again and the house disappeared. It was replaced with a giant inflatable bouncy castle. When Gintee waved a hand a third time, the bouncy castle was replaced by a giant commercial airplane. “You try.”
“Okay,” Jay said. Jay waved his hand and a cracked jar of dusty peanut butter appeared next to the airplane.
“It will take time. Concentrate. Visualize what you’re trying to create down to every last detail and let that image leave your imagination the same time that you wave your hand. Close your eyes if you have to. You can change details after it has been produced if need be.”
Jay closed his eyes and imagined his entire living room down to the last detail: the TV, the recliner, his mother’s lamp, the old brown carpet with the coffee stain in the corner of the room. After a few deep breaths he waved his hand. There it all was. Just as he remembered it. “Yahoo!” Jay jumped for joy and flopped down onto the recliner. He got out his remote, which was always kept in a drawer in the side table next to the recliner. He turned on the TV. “I think I want more channels,” said Jay, waving his hand. And just like that, he was flipping through every program known to man: streaming services, channels from other countries, pay per view, it was all there at his fingertips. 
Jay was bouncing up and down in his seat with excitement. This is the best thing ever. He waved his hand again and a bowl of steaming, buttery popcorn appeared on his lap. Then a plate of hot wings on the side table. Then a can of diet coke.
“Remember, the possibilities are endless,” Gintee said. But the voice was in Jay’s head again instead of behind him. Jay got up and looked all around. Gintee was gone.
Jay only shrugged his shoulders as he gave himself a full head of real hair. It was beautifully brown and wavy like Fabio’s. Come to think of it, I want to look really good like that guy, too. And Jay made it so. He also produced a mirror and admired his own reflection.
But the fate of the world. What is going to happen to everybody else? Jay shrugged his shoulders again and waved his hand again and again. It was out his control.
<|endoftext|>
The metallic air, along with the stench of runoff coolants, wafting up from the street through the rain smelled so acerbic that it made Leta imagine her nose hairs curling inward as she inhaled it, her stomach churning at the thought of it. She quickened her pace when she tasted bile at the tip of her tongue. She walked with her eyes downcast, trying to discourage any phantoms that might want to talk to her. How does anyone live here!
Of course, the scant few who lived on Metronome were either used to it or were crazy. Perhaps, they lived on it because they were all crazy. And she was in no rush to join them. “If only things hadn’t been this awful,” she muttered to herself, her boots clanking against the computer’s metallic body. “I’d still be home. Working on equational currents instead of worrying about the end of the Universe.” But it was her job to know, and that’s what she would do.
Through the pouring rain, she could see one of Metronome’s many Computational Units, the one she was supposed to meet Dex at, just a few feet away from her. Her heart fluttered at the thought of meeting him—she couldn’t help it. The acidic smell receded when she stepped under the eave of the Computational Unit. Huh, she thought, unbuckling her raincoat. Stench so thick, it needs water to rise up. Crazy, indeed. 
Maybe she was being unfair to the hardworking scientists of Metronome. These were bleak days for everyone. Bleaker still for scientists like her, who were watching the Universe end, unable to stop it—unable to even comprehend what was happening. Maybe she was tired from the long flight to this planet-sized computer. Maybe it was the bloody history of Metronome, the genocide from over a thousand years ago, which had wiped the indigenous people of the planet off it to pave the way for humanity’s most audacious invention, that had set her nerves afire. She had seen phantoms roam the streets of Metronome, rising from the metal along with its damp fetor. Or maybe it was just this meeting with Dex. “Terrible news,” he had said, calling her a week ago. “Dark days ahead.”
She stood under the eave for a little while and watched green raindrops fall onto the metallic streets of Metronome. Everything about this planet—if it could even be called one—was utterly unnatural. Yet, even as she felt its poison seep into her lungs, she understood that she was standing on humanity’s greatest creation. Metronome. A computer built into a planet itself. A computer so large that its body made up the streets of the planet, its processors fused with the planet’s very core. A computer that could understand the beginning of the Universe, and could project higher dimensions into the ones humans could perceive. A computer that might be able to explain why the Universe was dying. And hopefully, also tell Leta how to save it.
She shook her head. I can’t keep avoiding this. She turned to the door to the Computational Unit. It was a seamless aluminum wall, indistinguishable from its other walls, save for the circular glass tube that ran through its center. She placed her hand on the lock beside the circle. Soon, she felt a small prick at the base of her palm when the Identifier drew her blood for DNA verification. She pulled her hand back, rubbing at the place where the needle had pricked her.
“Dr. Leta Karli,” the SecCom chimed. “Welcome. Dr. Dex has been expecting you.”
Blue light flooded into the tube, casting a soft glow on Leta’s white uniform. Then the circle shifted outward and then swung inward. Leta steeled herself and stepped into Dex’s Unit.
She had seen Computational Units before. Her job entailed visiting this phantom planet every now and then. The Units were like little outcrops, built as extensions of Metronome’s body, where scientists could go to cast in equations, observe the mathematical currents of astronomical events, and obtain predictions and solutions from Metronome’s processors. Are we not a part of it? Leta wondered like she did every time she walked into a Computational Unit. We—these scientists—feed it problems to solve, and relay the results to the rest of humanity, and they live in it. Where does Metronome end? Where does their humanity begin?
Dex’s Unit was much like others she had been to. Thousands of copper-coated solar cells studded all over its circular wall, all placed there with the sole objective of powering the computer that was built in the center of the room. Beside the computer, she saw a couple of mattresses with empty food cartons on them. And in a chair in front of the computer, watching Leta with intent eyes, sat Dex.
He had grown a beard since she had last seen him, but still looked younger than she did. His brown lab coat hung from his firm shoulders, sticking close to his arms, and fell loosely around his legs. 
“Dex,” she asked. “How long since you last left the Unit?”
“Oh, I haven’t left in days,” Dex said, standing up to greet her. And while shaking her hand, he added, “Except, of course, to take a leak and then some.”
Leta smiled. “My dear Dex, the Universe is ending and you still cannot change.”
“Leta,” he said, turning to face the computer, his form illuminated in the light streaming out of it, “I think that the end of everything is the perfect time to do what one must.”
Chuckling, she stepped up beside him. She wanted to thank him for greeting her as if nothing had changed. Leta wasn’t sure if she’d have been this welcoming had Dex shown up back home. Even now, standing beside her friend who now looked so unfamiliar, she couldn’t believe that he had chosen to work on Metronome. Maybe she was still mad at him for abandoning her. Or maybe she knew that the phantoms would get to him.
And they had. Dex from seven years ago would have never let himself be indoctrinated into the false religion of the Lost Jatahu. This Dex, who looked so unfamiliar now, wore the seal of the Lost Jatahu around his neck. The pendant rested on his chest, where his lab coat showed skin.
Leta huffed internally. If one could blaspheme against science, this would be it.
Things had changed. She needed to remember that.
“Dex, I haven’t known peace since you called me,” she said. “That cryptic phone call of yours. Tell me, and tell it to me straight. What have you learned?”
Dex stood there with his eyes focused on the computer screen. Finally, he asked,
“Have you heard of Mizken?”
Leta shut her eyes, trying to keep her frustration from showing. “Dex, please—”
“Mizken was the SaarPanch—the tribe leader—of the largest northern tribe here on Jatahu,” he said. Then, he looked at her. “My apologies. Of course, here on Metronome.”
“Dex—” Leta said, but Dex interrupted her again.
“He lived on the planet until only two years before we blew it to hell,” he began. “He was the bravest this world had ever known. Strong. Smarter than us scientists, they say. They say that had he been around when we came, we never would have been able to build Metronome here.
“Alas, Kihn—curse that fool—a member of Mizken’s tribe rebelled against him. That rat went so far as to plot his own leader’s murder. They say Mizken was long dead by the time Kihn went to murder him. Died from a broken heart, they say. Betrayed by his kin. Well, they got what was coming for them.”
Despite herself, Leta asked, “What did they get?”
“Huh?” Dex asked as if he hadn’t just been preaching about it.
“Kihn, and the rest of the Jatahu people?” Leta asked.
“That’s a rather silly question,” he said, smiling. “They got us. Blowing their planet to hell.”
A chill perked up in the pit of her stomach and sent a jolt up her spine.
“They say Mizken brought us to this planet. Jatahu people believe that they were their god’s special creations, that they could access him like no one else. Mizken went to their god and with His help led humanity here. And we took care of the rest.”
His eyes were so stern that his penetrating gaze made her feel exposed. The last time she had seen him, childlike humor was all he was. But there was more to him now. How deep is he in this religion? What’s this got to do with the death of the Universe?
“Terrible leader,” he said. “Well, anyway. Yes.”
Leta started. “Yes what?”
“The Universe is ending,” he declared.
She had known that for over a year now, had studied possible causes for astronomical bodies ceasing all movement, for the light they emitted freezing in place. But this was a terrible confirmation, one she never really wished to hear. Not from Dex, not on Metronome.
“I… I need to sit…” she said, her throat drying up.
He brought her his chair. She plopped down in it. The universe is dying! “Why?” she croaked.
He placed a hand on her shoulder. “This is going to be hard, Leta. We can talk about it in some.”
She looked up at the man who had once been her friend. But all she could see was the symbol he wore. “And what do we do in the meantime?” she barked at him. “Another pathetic lesson in the history of the Lost Jatahu? Want to take another shot at me? Remind me that I am a horrible person for not moving here with you—to atone for the sins of our ancestors, was it?”
He cringed. “Leta—”
“Or better yet: convert me! Yes, teach me the sick ways of your religion of ghosts, and give me one of these pendants!”
“Leta!” he said, his voice stern. “Enough!” Then he crouched in front of her, his eyes locking onto hers. For a bizarre moment, she thought he might kiss her. But he simply grabbed her shoulders. “You need to calm down. I know it’s a lot to ask of a person who’s just been told that their universe is dying, but you need to stay calm if you want to understand what is happening to the Universe. Can you do that?”
She swallowed but nodded. She had known that he would only confirm their theories. And she was a scientist. She would understand why reality was breaking, even as it broke her. That’s what she did.
She got out of the chair and turned to face the computer. “Show me.”
He dragged that chair to the computer and sat in it. Then he pulled his work up on the screen. Leta noticed something odd. His database consisted of files from more than a year ago. Leta, and other scientists from multiple worlds, had been at that problem for over a year too. But Metronome was brought into the equation only after months of fruitless toil. In a way, it was ironic. Humanity’s greatest invention, built upon a planet-wide genocide, was seldom used for the very same reason. In the scientific community, there were certain superstitions about Metronome. And then there were the phantoms, the ghosts of the Jatahu people that the locals said roamed Metronome’s metallic streets. Leta shivered remembering the hazy air to her right as she had walked in the rain. Surely, it was my mind playing tricks on me. Surely, it was.
“How did you begin your work over a year ago when the Board approved your involvement only two months ago?” she asked.
He paused and looked at her. “The universe is ending, Leta. Not really a time for bureaucratic loyalty.” He turned back to the computer. “And besides, there are many things you don’t know about this place.”
Then, he said, “So, only a month ago did we learn this. Your theories about what was happening were mostly accurate. The planetary system that froze first was a thousand lightyears away. You can see on the screen when its planets stopped moving around it, when the luminosity dips stopped. And it’s not just that one of the planets stopped, right? All of them stopped.”
“Yes, and others started to follow. Distant systems and rogue astronomical bodies stopped moving, as if a video was paused, a frame frozen,” Leta said.
“Yes,” he said, nodding. “But the thing that tipped us off was something Metronome observed five weeks ago. All the extra-solar objects that stopped, didn’t stop suddenly.”
“You mean they stopped flashing warning signs?” Leta asked.
“Yes, they did! But those were too minute for anything but Metronome to notice. The planets, the stars, the light they gave off—all of them—slowed before they stopped! Like a wind-up toy slowing down as its torsion spring unwinds. That’s what’s happening to the Universe, Leta! We’re—”
Leta finished his thought. “Running out of time.”
He sat back with his strong eyes fixated on her. “Yes, we are. We thought that spacetime was a unified entity, that Time was something woven into the very fabric of the Universe. But that’s not the true nature of time. It’s… extra-universal!”
“Dex,” she said carefully. “This is the wildest thing I’ve ever heard. You’re essentially saying that Time existed before the Universe was born, that Time exists beyond the Universe. So, what? The Universe just draws Time into itself, and that well is drying up? You’re implying that there were universes before ours, or at least that the beginning of the Universe was just another event on a timeline older than itself. Are you sure about this?”
He stood up, took her hands into his, and said, “Leta, this isn’t some theory of mine. This is what the evidence dictates. This is what Metronome has deduced. Whatever happened at the beginning of the Universe, it didn’t happen all over all at once. The Universe began in phases, different regions of it beginning at distinct points in time. It wasn’t really a Big Bang. It was more like a Big Wave. And the wave was Time. It came to the Universe and the Universe began. And now that wave is receding. The sea will be quiet again.”
There was a temporary solution to this, but the large-scale implication was soul-crushing. They both went quiet for a while until Leta said, “So, we calculate when Time will freeze here—when entropy will be neutralized in an arbitrary equilibrium—move our civilization to a different location before that happens, and wait till Time runs out there as well?”
“Yes,” he said. “That’s what we have to do. With this new information, Metronome has calculated potentially habitable regions with the highest concentration of Time—the newest regions of the Universe. But…”
Leta perked up. “But what?”
He turned away from her. “You don’t want to know what I think.”
“Oh, Dex,” she said, stepping around to face him. “How I wish to hear everything you’ve been thinking. It’s been too long, my friend. We’ve been away too long. Please. Please, tell me what you think.”
He looked at her and smiled. Suddenly, he seemed so much older, the wrinkles around his eyes seemed so much deeper. “I think we deserve it.”
How dare he wish extinction upon his own people! His religion!
Her eyes drifted to his pendant as he brought it up to his eyes and uttered a silent prayer. Then he said, “The Jatahu believed that they were their god's special creations. It’s said that when we exterminated them, they went to Him and begged that justice be served. They speak of this. It’s that their god has hunted us down ever since the day we killed them. A thousand years ago.”
Leta almost gasped when she realized what he meant. It all made a morbid sort of sense. A thousand years ago, humans had destroyed the Jatahu people. That’s when the first planetary system stopped. And what of the phantoms she saw every time she visited Metronome? But no. Her rational mind understood that she only saw those phantoms because she had been told she would. “Coincidence,” she said.
“Maybe,” he whispered, his eyes latched onto hers, their faces dangerously close. “But soil still breathes beneath all this metal, Leta. What do you think grows there?”
Her eyes were focused on the tip of his nose as she felt his gravity almost pull her in. Almost. She moved away, for things were still terribly broken between them. But the Universe was dying around them and she still hoped to save humanity, albeit temporarily. Perhaps things that were broken could be fixed, albeit arduously.
“I’ll let the Board know about your discoveries,” Leta said.
He cleared his throat. “Yes, and I’ll be there to present my case in person, of course. Sorry for saying that we all deserve to die.”
She shook her head. “I don’t blame you. While I don’t think we deserve to die for the crimes our ancestors committed a thousand years ago, I do believe that there’s more truth to your words than I can understand right now.”
He looked genuinely surprised.
“Perhaps,” Leta said. “You can tell me more about what you think when you come to see the Board.”
“I… uh… of course… I mean, yes.”
Leta smiled, finally seeing a glimpse of her old friend. But she understood that she would also have to get used to the man he had become. She was a scientist—it was her job to know. And she would love to know him again.
“And anyway,” Leta said, turning to leave, “their god will catch up with us eventually. And then we’ll get what we deserve. Whatever it may be.”
<|endoftext|>
“Okay this is it, old girl. Ready?”
Mollie licked her nose making sure it was wet enough, shook her shaggy head at her best friend in the whole world, to bravely say in her poochy way that she was ready. This was what she was born to do and had spent years learning to understand her master’s demands and perfect the mission she was about to carry out. What started as sit, talk and stay soon evolved into pick up, open, count and then in recent months she learnt to write. Well, as much as a dog can manage with a pen in her mouth. It was good enough as a back up plan but she wouldn’t be writing an autobi-dog-graphy just yet.
Mollie’s master walked over from the other side of the laboratory holding the harness she knew all too well. Lifting the top of her cage, he ruffled the hair around her collar whilst carefully putting the harness over her head, clicked it underneath her legs so it successfully hung over her back like a high tech saddle. This was no normal harness, it was her equivalent of a superhero utility belt and was essential to her mission. Taking one last check of the items in the harness, her master slowly walked back to the control panel on the other side of the lab, past all the unopened post and half eaten sandwiches and let out a huge sigh.
“Here we go!”
Putting on his blacked out goggles, Mollie’s master typed in the sequence he’d done a thousand times before and turned the activation key. The plastic surround to the big red button flipped open. Closing his eyes and before he changed his mind Mollie’s master slammed his hand down hard on the red button.
The metallic table top Mollie’s cage was sat on began to spin, slowly increasing in speed faster and faster over the next 30 seconds until the centrifugal force was pinning her to the floor. Mollie could feel her stomach flip multiple times with the speed increasing further and further until she heard the fizzing of something surrounding the metal sides of the cage. Opening her scruffy left eye she was immediately greeted with the familiar sight of the blue glow of a wormhole. Mollie felt weightless as she floated around her cage which then also lifted off the top of the shiny table and drifted into the black space within the blue wormhole. With papers and sandwich flying around the lab Mollie’s master screamed “YES!” at the top of his lungs. Floaty Mollie and her cage disappeared into the wormhole which swallowed them whole and then prematurely imploded.
Hurtling through space and time wasn’t the best thing Mollie had done today. She’d put her walk in the woods top, closely followed by her steak and dog food breakfast, a cuddle from her master and then this. Her ears flapped either side of her head feeling the speed of the blue glowing pathway channelling her hopefully towards the correct destination. In the distance Mollie spotted a bright light that was surrounded by the same blue glow, the cage changed direction with a jolt and began to head straight for it. Before she could brace for impact our shaggy traveller shot through the lit up wormhole, hit the ground hard, the cage turned on its side, skidding to a halt a few yards away in a bush.
Her head was spinning but Mollie didn’t feel injured in any way which was a relief after what happened to Flopsy, the last test subject. As a precaution, her master had packed some bandages in her utility harness and it had taken ages to learn how to wrap them around her legs and paws. The alarm beeped in one of her pockets. She had ten minutes precisely. The top of the cage was already open so Mollie was out of her bashed up time machine in seconds, leapt through the bush to freedom and sprinted to the first location. 
Her wet nose turned the corner first out of the alley way into the high street and only a few seconds away from the first stop in her mission. Thankfully the wormhole had dropped her near to the expected location and Mollie had completed a number of test missions in preparation for this scenario. Leaping through the door of the newsagents Mollie galloped up to the cashier and jumped onto the checkout. Coming face to face with a dog was an unexpected experience for cashier Tracey on this Wednesday but she took it in her stride.
“Hello lovely, where have you come from?”
Mollie swung her head round to her utility harness and grabbed a piece of paper in her mouth. Flapping the paper in front of the cashier a guttural woof came from deep inside Mollie’s throat. Tracey took the paper from this strange dog’s mouth and looked at it. Minus the dog phlegm, it was a perfectly filled in lottery ticket for the next two Fridays’ draws. 
“Not sure if I can put this through for a dog? Have you got any money?”
Mollie sniffed around her harness once more and grabbed something else to give to Tracey. Swinging back round to face the cashier, inside her mouth was a crisp five pound note. Taking the cash was a real head scratcher for Tracey but quickly scanning the rules, she couldn’t find anything about not serving dogs. As long as the owner claims it, what’s the problem?
Shrugging her shoulders Tracey put the lottery ticket through the machine, slid the five pounds into the till and gave Mollie her change and ticket by slotting them into an empty pocket in the harness. Barking twice as a doggy equivalent of “Cheers love!” Mollie leapt off the counter and dashed out of the newsagents towards part two of her mission, leaving Tracey to wonder if she had dreamt the last few minutes of her day.
Time was running out so Mollie had to cut a few corners, namely dashing in and out of speeding traffic to get to the right building before it was too late. However, something wasn’t right. She smelt something familiar that wasn’t meant to be outside of the building she was heading towards. Mollie made it across the road in one piece despite being distracted. She stopped in her tracks in the centre of the square in front of her destination. Trotting in a circle she sniffed and then sniffed again until she saw him. Sitting on a bench eating his lunch was Mollie’s desired target – her master. She galloped towards him and then leapt into his arms startling him. Her master’s anger at his lunch falling to the floor, as at this point in the timeline he hadn’t even thought of owning a dog let alone sending it through time, soon evaporated when Mollie licked his face repeatedly with delight.
“Oh okay, calm down! Shouldn’t I buy you a drink first? Hehe” joked her master.
Mollie realised she was losing sight of the mission. She got off her master’s lap, and grabbed the ticket from her harness. Handing it to her master he took a close look at the lottery ticket with a confused frown.
“What’s this for?”
Mollie had forgotten to give her master something else. She quickly sniffed her harness and crumpled up at the bottom of one of the pockets in her harness was gift number two. Clutching it tightly with her teeth she wrestled it out of the pocket. Her master took it off her, straightened it out and saw his name on the front of this mysterious envelope.
“Oh?? Should I open it?”
Mollie barked loudly. Her master slightly startled took out the letter and began to read it quietly to himself. A few seconds into this spoiler heavy write up a loud beep came from inside Mollie’s harness. Oh no! That means she has a minute before the wormhole opens up and then another minute before it closes! Giving her master one last lick Mollie jumped off the bench and ran for her past, present and future life.
“WAIT!” cried her master but she was already halfway across the road, avoiding car tyres and bonnets by millimetres. Jumping for the kerb she got there just before a lorry almost took out her back legs. The wormhole was only round a couple more street corners but something told her to stop running. The screeching of tyres, raised voices and panicked screams behind her told Mollie the horrific truth before she saw it with her own puppy dog eyes. Sprinting back to the kerb she saw a car stopped in the road, the driver kneeling on the ground screaming for someone to call an ambulance and lying lifeless on the tarmac staring directly at Mollie was her master. He wasn’t moving at all, her best friend was hurt because of her. Her heart ripped into several pieces. This whole mission was to help him and now he was dead. She didn’t know what to do. Maybe she could help him? Maybe he wasn’t dead yet! All of those options were incinerated when the second alarm began to beep in her harness. She had to run for her life or she would be stuck in the past forever.
With tears streaming down her face, her auto pilot took over when her paws dragged Mollie away from the tragic scene, down an alley way, up a stairwell, over a fence and into the street where she first arrived. It was pure muscle memory taking over as Mollie’s shaggy head was definitely not in the game. With 100 metres to go Mollie’s glazed eyes sprung to life and could see the wormhole closing. As if a rocket had been lit in her butt she found a sixth gear and darted into the car park watching the nearby glowing wormhole getting smaller and smaller. With five metres left she launched her body towards the tiny hole, trying to make herself into a doggy javelin. Her head made it through, then front paws, her tummy barely got past the rim of this shrinking entrance and finally with no seconds left her tail travelled into the wormhole milliseconds before it would have been sliced off. And just like that, Mollie and the hole were gone.
Mollie’s tail may have gone into the wormhole last but due to the timey wimey washing machine nature of the journey her backside was first to shoot out of the other end. Her entire body flew across the room and slid into a nearby table whilst the fizzing portal quietly disappeared. 
Opening her eyes and attempting to shake off the impact Mollie took a look at her surroundings. It looked like the old lab but much shinier with more boops and beeps coming from nearby machines. The double doors to the room slid open and in walked a familiar face.
“There she is!” said Mollie’s master marching into the centre of the room. She began to race towards him but stopped dead when her eyes met his glistening metal prosthetic legs. His could see she was frightened.
“I know, lots to talk about! I was dumb to chase after you but thankfully other than losing my legs the doctors saved my life. I claimed the lottery ticket once I was discharged and I was able to invest millions in the company. We did it old girl!”
Mollie’s couldn’t understand everything he said but his body language suggested it was positive. Her tail was wagging so much she could almost take flight. Kneeling down to dog level, Mollie and her master embraced becoming a tangle of paws and arms. She was so busy licking her master’s face she didn’t notice him pull something from out of his lab coat pocket, gently insert it into the ruff of her neck and begin to plunge the deadly contents into her bloodstream.
Before anything left the syringe, Mollie’s master was struck hard and sent crashing against the far wall slumping in an unconscious heap onto the floor. Spinning her entire body round Mollie came face to face with her master’s attacker. She made a guttural growl, teeth bared ready to strike. That was swiftly replaced by a confused whine when she saw the person in front of her was a giant robot dog. Before she could get her bearings the robot began to talk in a monotone mechanical voice.
“Mollie, we don’t have much time. Your master will regain consciousness in ten seconds. He was about to kill you with lethal injection to cover his tracks.”
Looking over at her crumpled master, Mollie could see the syringe in his hand. She let out a poochy gasp.
“I’ve been sent from the future to take you back. Quick, jump into the time loop before it’s too late!”
Even if you were a super genius, this would be too much to comprehend in one go. For a dog, even one as clever as Mollie, this was frying her brain. She would need days to figure this all out but her doggy instincts were telling her to get out of there. Taking a running jump Mollie landed on the other side of the portal on the start of her journey to who knows where. Her new canine cyborg friend followed shortly afterwards and only unfinished echoes of her master’s voice could be heard from the lab as the hole closed shut behind them.
“Mollie, don’t listen to…”

The few words I typed up stare at me from the screen, my hands hovering above the keyboard, whilst I’m mindlessly tapping it with my claws. I’ve gathered all the data, all I need to do is write.
“Humanity: The Ethics of  Earth’s Most Invasive Species
An essay by Dr Scaly Greene
Sources: The Official Interstellar Data Collection Log of Inhabited Planets vol. 69 (focusing on the data collected from “Earth” in the category “mammals” and subcategory “homo sapiens”) and the discussion thread of “Evolving to Extinction” on  LightYears, the number one evidence based academic forum on the Space Wide Web.
The– ”
I cannot focus.
My coffee, (a disgusting substance I acquired from Earth among other popular beverages to try whilst studying the humans and have given up on after the first sip) has gone cold and the only light left is the artificial cold-blue glow of my screen. The bright sky has faded to black some time ago outside the glass walls. I’m not sure how long I have been sitting there motionless, when I hear the click of the lightswitch and warmth fills the room from the infrared lamp.
I turn my head towards the door and see Dash in his long cloak by the lightswitch, his pinkish-white scales shining like pure gold under the red light.
‘Thank you.’ I smile at him.
‘You should pay more attention to temperature regulation.’ He observes and walks over, carrying the subtle scent of disinfectant I always notice when he comes home from the hospital.
Without taking off his cloak, he joins me on the little bench at my desk. I wish he didn’t feel the need to wear it, but he’s been trying his best to cover up his tail since it grew back forking two ways after the incident. 
‘Sorry.’ I say as I breathe in his hospital-clean scent,  the scent of  guilt. “Sorry” is never just about whatever I need to apologise for in the moment anymore, but the incident too, and how I’ve messed up. 
Sometimes I still can’t believe he pulled through, considering the amount of blood I mopped up the white floor after I put him in our fridge for a whole month to regenerate, unsure whether he would make it out alive. That was the first time I understood the phenomenon I observed in species with religions: the urge to pray for those dearest to your heart. Whether the universe heard me, I do not know, but Dash lived, not only regrowing the missing half of his tail, but doing so twice over. There isn’t anything wrong with that; it’s common for lost limbs to grow back twice, and there isn’t anything you can do about it: your body just does it. (Just like when Spike, the eldest of my nineteen twins, bit his tongue off, and that grew back twice, giving him an awful lot of trouble with his speech.) But I get it. Nobody wants to be “different”.
I missed Dash, whilst he was hibernating to heal. When I finally got him out of the fridge and into our bed and warmed him up to wake him, I tried to joke about how he was such an overachiever, always exceeding expectations, whilst he held his new tail. I was never any good at reading the room. 
“I don’t want this…”
Seeing his tears broke my heart, but the fact he lived held those sore pieces together. I don’t think I was wrong to fridge him, in those dire circumstances.
I also don’t think I will ever say the word sorry again and not think of what I’ve done. 
‘How was aqua therapy today..?’ I ask gently, and he turns his head away, whilst arranging his cloak to cover his tail properly. 
‘Horrible as always.’ He sighs. I can’t even begin to imagine how he must feel when he has to swim around in the pool, under the watchful eyes of his doctors. He doesn't even let me accompany him to his appointments. “I don’t want you to see it,” he says every time, but we both know I’ve seen it already. When he was in the fridge, I watched with growing anxiety, and when he was warming up under the infra light, of course, I took a closer look. As I examined the changes, I hoped he would forgive me, for I would never forgive myself.
‘It’s like I lost half the control in my tail,’ he continues, ‘the whole new part feels foreign, and the shorter end I still cannot move. They say it might stay paralyzed. They say it might always feel… off.’
‘I’m sorry…’ I pick at the shedding skin on my arm. I wish there was something, anything I could do to make it better. Dash pulls my hand away.
‘Hey. You always tell me not to do this. Your new skin will come out nicer if you just give it time.’ 
I give him a faint smile. At least he didn’t get the shedding anxiety this time, which tends to loom over us both during the weeks we change skin.
‘You are right.’
‘I always am.’ He picks up my coffee and takes a sip before I could warn him about the taste. He spits it all over my desk straight away. ‘What the..?’
‘I am trying the human’s food from Earth whilst researching them…’ I murmur, as I get up to towel the desk clean, whilst he is trying to wipe the bitter taste off his long blue tongue. 
‘Try this, it’s much nicer.’ I give him a jar of honey as I sit back down.
‘Humans make this..?’ he licks into it with caution.
‘Bees make it. Little fuzzy insects who play a quintessential role in that planet’s ecosystem. They are highly sophisticated and… Just look.’ I open a picture for reference.
‘Aww. He’s got a little basket!’ He smiles into the jar  as he is licking the inside clean, revealing for a moment his perfectly aligned needle sharp set of teeth. 
‘She,’ I correct him, savouring the sight of his perfect smile, ‘all the workers are female. Actually, when you consider the fate of their male peers, it makes me sad, but… anyway, my research is about humans, not bees.’
‘What are they like?’
‘A little bit like us, they are the pioneers of invention and discovery on their home planet. However, as a much younger species, they are behind us in terms of technological advances. It isn't for the lack of trying on their part, but according to our forecast it’s unlikely that they would reach the level of sophistication required to be invited to join the Intergalactic Alliance and gain access to the Space Wide Web forums before their extinction.’
‘Can you show me one?’ 
He leans forwards with curiosity and I smile at how he forgets to care whether he would accidentally pull his cloak off his tail. Wondering if he did, I gently touch my tail to his behind us on the floor as I pull up a picture of humans, watching his reaction. 
He tenses up a little at the sensation of my dry, shedding tail touching his smooth, new scales and I pull back fast: my flaky skin must not feel very nice on that tender and young tail right now. Maybe, after I shed it all.
‘Uhm…’ Dash grimaces at the pictures of the humans.
‘It’s okay, you can say it.’ I try to suppress a smile.
‘They have hair in weird places. We aren’t like them, are we?’
‘No… You are much more handsome.’ I glance at him, meeting his turquoise eyes for a moment just long enough to see his slit pupils take on a rounder shape. I lick my forehead as I turn back to my screen, feeling a little too hot. Clearing my throat, I ramble on.
‘And you know what? There is a group of humans who would agree with me on that. Remember when I said, that if you didn’t exist you’d have to be invented? Well, they invented you!’ I show him an illustration of a handsome reptilian by a human artist.
‘That’s… me? Impressive.’
‘Right? I’ll set it as wallpaper.’
‘Are you sure you didn’t draw that, Scaly?’
‘I swear it’s from Earth!’ I laugh. ‘Humans have very… diverse tastes and ideologies. This, I think, is their biggest charm but also their worst trait.’
‘How is that possible?’ He reaches for the remote on my desk and switches the infra light off and the cooling light and fan on.
‘It’s… complicated. Are you really interested? I don’t want to just ramble on and bore you to death. Also, aren’t you hungry? I can get some dinner…’
‘It’s not boring, I like learning about the aliens from an expert. Do you have more snacks from Earth? The honey was really good.’
‘I do… Alright. But don’t tell anyone we just had them for dinner, because they are meant for my research and I want to claim back the fees of intergalactic teleportation as work expenses.’ I warn him, as I pull out the big box of treats from under the desk.
‘You are the best.’ he smiles as he dives into the snackbox. I think I am the worst, with lots to make up for. I simply cannot say no to him.
‘Back to the aliens.’ I say as he gives me a curved yellow fruit and I bite half of it off. The exterior is not really to my taste but the inside is quite sweet and mushy. ‘Hm. The inside is alright.' I hand him the other half. ‘Where was I..?’
‘Diverse tastes and ideologies.’ Dash volunteers whilst slicing the fruit’s skin off with his claws. ‘Humans make these?’
‘Kind of, they bred the plant.’
‘Because of their diverse taste?’
‘Yes! That’s a great example. Humans seem to have this strange attitude: when they don’t like a natural thing, they either change it to create something they like, or claim that it is unnatural, and therefore, wrong, so that they can continue disliking it. In addition to that, they don’t all agree on what is natural and what is wrong.’
‘But… The thing they change and make it so they like it, that is unnatural.’
‘Exactly.’
‘I see why you’re stuck on page one.’ Dash smiles. ‘I guess it isn't only food they do this with?’
‘No, unfortunately not. I have a whole presentation saved just about this topic. Wanna look at the pictures?’
Nodding, he shuffles closer to me, with a packet of “popcorn” in his hands. The contents of the bag look nothing like the print on it, and it sounds like he is crunching on little rocks.
‘Is that nice..?’
‘The seasoning is, but… I assumed humans had really weak jaws. I suppose that can’t be right.’
‘I’ll make a note of that.’ I nod as I open the slides.
‘First, there is an incomplete collection about natural things they– some humans claim are unnatural or wrong. So… brace yourself for the contradictions. Here we have: body hair on female specimens — observed to grow naturally, not wanting to reproduce — which is a natural trait observed in some humans across all sexes and genders, non-heteronormative attraction — another natural trait observed in many species on Earth and intergalactically in most species that are divided into more than one sex. Basically, for every human there will be another to judge them for being wrong.’
‘...would some of them think that we are wrong, too?’
‘It’s hard to say… Some of those things would not even apply: we are all the same sex and we have scales instead of hair. Besides, we aren’t humans, and they don’t judge other species the same as they judge their own.’
‘But some humans would adore me and the rest would think they are mad?’
‘Probably!’
‘What if we were humans but everything else stayed the same? So we are a same sex human couple–’
‘Which sex?’
‘Which one doesn’t lay eggs in their species?’
‘Neither, they’re mammals.’
‘Oh. Doesn’t matter, then. So, we are those, without any plans for eggs… I mean offsprings, and a preference for reptilians, especially, the deep green type, in freshly shedded skin, when the soft scales still feel a bit moist and–’
‘Ah, quiet!’ I put my hands over his mouth, and even with the cooling fan on I can feel my face burn. 
‘You're so embarrassing you know that? You just out-weirded humanity.’ I say awkwardly, and he laughs into my palms. I roll my eyes as I let go of him, but I am happy he is back to flirting with me, for the first time since I got him out of the fridge two months ago.
‘Mid-tier life forms are so fascinating.’ He grins. ‘They’re all so messed up… I’m glad they cannot be part of the Alliance.’
‘Right? But for that, there are many more reasons. I’ll show you a few things they altered… Ah, it’s that fruit. It’s called a banana.’
‘Hm. That’s not bad.’
‘No, there’s nothing wrong with this one.’ I agree. The next slides are about how they bred other animal species into completely different subtypes.
‘This is the canine type mammal… They all used to look like this, the… “wolf”. And now… see?’
‘Is this problematic? I would like to say yes, but they look so happy.’
‘I don’t know… But then, sometimes they modify them even more forcefully.’ The next slide is puppies before and after having their ears cut pointy, in the name of fashion, and the next, more pups with and then without their tails. 
My heart drops before I hear Dash’s soft exhale and the sound of his claws ripping through the packet of popcorn as he grips it, scattering the dry corn over the floor. Panicking, I jump up and try to move onto the next slide so quickly I miss the button three times before we are on a harmless picture of a river. My hands are shaking and Dash is staring at his hands, eyes wide open, trying to catch his breath. I switch on the infra light.
‘I’m sorry I forgo–’ I bite my tongue. ‘I’m sorry.’ I turn towards him. I am an idiot. He deserves so much better. 
‘I really am sorry.’ I touch his shoulder gently. ‘Dash?’
‘You won’t bring any of them… Promise you won’t bring any of them… No humans.’ he mutters, trembling.
‘No… I won’t. I promise.’ I decided back then, after the incident, that I wasn’t going to get another live specimen teleported here ever again. It wasn’t worth the risk, and I was so careless in taking it in the first place. It could have ended much worse, Dash could have lost much more than his tail and a month of his life in the fridge, and it would be on me. 
It is on me.
‘Not even when I’m away. Not even when you are away, to work in another lab. Never.’
‘Never. Never. I swear it, I will never bring anything live over to study, not even the most harmless looking plant, not the tiniest insect… Never again.’
‘And definitely not any more monsters.’ he whispers, and I desperately try not to picture that last one, the giant, monstrous creature with its big jaw, strong teeth, and Dash’s tail in its huge mouth. 
‘No. No more monsters.’
He holds my gaze, and with time, his eyes soften.
‘You are doing it again.’ He puts his hand on mine. I didn't even notice I was clawing off my old skin, still alive in patches and now sticky with blood in a few places. I can’t feel any of it.
‘It's fine.’ I hide my arm behind my back.
‘No, it is day three, it’s way too early to peel it. Let me see!’
‘It’s day four.’ I say, not like it matters at all. You can’t safely shed the old skin until the end of day six or the morning of day seven. 
‘Come on Dash, you know I don’t like you looking at me when I am shedding. I look hideous.’
‘...I understand. Me too. Now even when I am not shedding.’ he gives me a hard look, and though he usually tries not to say it, I can see the blame, I can hear the accusation in his tone. It scares me, because it is so right and justified and I cannot blame him if he wants to leave me.
‘Fine, look!’ I put my arm in front of his nose. ‘Disgusting, right? And it is not even the worst thing about me, is it? The worst thing is all this reckless research, the worst thing is that I didn’t even think about your safety, and even now I–’ I break off as he looks up at me, unable to carry on with self-deprecation. I don’t need to spell out I’m garbage.
‘I’m sorry.’ I repeat helplessly. ‘I’m sorry for bringing that thing into our home. I’m sorry for what happened; for the pain and the fridge and I’m sorry for your beautiful tail and I miss it too… but I really don’t think there is anything wrong with the new one and I hate how you hate a part of yourself. Isn’t it incredible it grew back? If it didn’t…’ I find I am unable to say it.
‘You… really don’t hate it?’
‘I like all of you.’ I say quietly. ‘But I know I don’t deserve any.’
‘Maybe it is exactly what you deserve,’ he whispers, barely audible, ‘this, a constant reminder of how you could’ve gotten both of us killed. Is that what you really want to look at, every day, for the rest of our lives? Me as a freak, like this?’ He pulls his cloak to the side, revealing his new tail.
I don’t have to think twice about my answer.
‘More than anything.’
<|endoftext|>
The man across the table did not seem to blink, like at all. His eyelids never even fluttered behind his heavy blackframed glasses. They had locked on her from the moment she sat down and had not left her face. His partner next to him was far more animated. 
Least that one pretends to be somewhat human, Claire thought.
“You are Ms. Irving? Ms. Claire Irving?,” he asked. 
The manila folder lay open in front of him and Claire could clearly see her headshot photo in the top corner but the man did not look down when he asked the question.
“You came to my work and asked Mr. Marlowe for me. You obviously know who I am so why don’t you tell me what this is all about,” Claire said. She crossed her arms and sighed audibly. This was ridiculous…talking to these two government suits and this guy wanted to ask twenty obvious questions.
“Ms. Irving,” the other man spoke. “Do you mind if we call you Claire? We’d like to keep this informal. We just have a few minor questions.”
“You can call me Claire and I’m going to call you a bullshitter, no offense,” Claire said. “From my side of the table it looks like you have more than a few minor questions. You show up here, folder and all. Any time one of you CIA types has prepared a folder it’s anything but minor. So let’s cut the crap.”
“Fine, Agent Lynch and myself would like to know more about Dr. Tomorrow and Recollections, Inc.,” said the glasses man.
“Lynch? Don’t you guys kinda wear that one out?”
Lynch smiled faintly.
“You’ve clearly read my articles about Dr. Tomorrow and his company, Claire muttered. “So what could I possibly tell you that you don’t already know?”
“Ms. Irving, we do not have time for you to play coy,” the man with the glasses said. “Answer our questions here or answer them down at…” Lynch placed a hand on his arm.
“Easy, Smith,” Lynch said. “Look, Claire, since his series of interviews with you, Dr. Tomorrow and his company has maintained a flat refusal to work with any other media.”
Lynch leaned forward, looking at Claire over the top of his glasses.
“What makes you so special?”
“I don’t know,” Claire shrugged. “Recollections, Inc. reached out to me this time last year after my series on violent crimes ran.”
“Violent crimes?” Lynch asked, taking off his glasses and wiping them clean with a tissue before pushing them back on his face.
“The number of violent crimes in the city was on an uptick. My pieces focused on possible resources victims could use to move on with their lives and recover. Tomorrow’s secretary called and said he was interested in speaking with me.”
“I don’t blame you for not passing that one up,” Lynch leaned back and met Claire’s eyes. 
“Are you kidding me? Dr. James Tomorrow, inventor of the Recollection tech, wanted to talk to me?” Claire smirked. “Shit, that phone call was better than some one night stands I’ve had. I practically had to have a cigarette afterward.”
Agent Lynch cocked an eyebrow. Agent Smith remained unchanged.
“Tough crowd,” Claire shook her head. “Anyways, that was it. A security badge was sent over to the Herald for me and I reported there the next day…no, two days later. I met with Tomorrow three more times and did my write up. The story ran and people ate it up,” 
She shrugged, “He was an inventor who developed a way to overwrite bad memories. That kind of sci-fi shit always draws readers in but...” 
She gestured toward Lynch and Smith’s folder.
“You already know that,” she sat back. “But Tomorrow was…”
“Was what?” Smith asked.
“He was…well, he was Tomorrow. Not like anyone else,” Claire remembered. She told them about arriving at Tomorrow’s office for the first time…
It was a simple office for a guy who had just changed the world, basically overnight. Beige carpet, long wood table and a bar cart in the corner. The man seated at the table was as nondescript as the room - average height and build with short blonde hair, parted to the side. The man wore wire framed glasses and had sharp blue eyes that were focused on the task in front of him. 
That was what drew her attention the most.
The man was peeling hard boiled eggs. He placed the shells into a large, stainless steel bowl, then sliced the egg in half, placing the whites in another bowl and the yolks, intact, into the smallest bowl. The faint egg smell wafted to Claire’s nose, causing her to sniff. That sniff is what drew Tomorrow from his work. 
“Hello Claire,” Tomorrow smiled brightly, stood up, and shook her hand with a damp hand. Whether it was moisture from the eggs or sweat, Claire couldn’t tell. The smile far outweighed the wet handshake. 
The inventor had a smile that felt like the two of them shared a past, full of inside jokes he was dying to laugh at with her. He smiled while he said her name, like he had been waiting all day just to say hello to her.
“Welcome to Recollections!” He held his hands out grandly, like a showmaster. In one hand he still held his paring knife. He realized quickly and set the knife down. “Sorry about that. For some reason after the procedure many of our patients experience a loss in proteins and vitamin D.”
“A problem easily remedied by our friend the egg,” Tomorrow said. He held up a glistening egg white for Claire to see. “We separate the yolk from the whites because we have found the whites are easier on our patient’s stomachs. They have to fast for 48 hours you see…”
“And that was how our interview started,” Claire scratched her head. “He told me about creating the hippocampus shunt and immersion chamber.”
“So you know about this then?” Smith asked. 
His partner held up a small black object, flat on one end and cylindrical on the other. The flat end was sheath, containing the sharp end of the shunt. 
“It’s a hippo shunt, but…” Claire’s forehead furrowed. “How did you get that? I’ve never seen one outside of Recollection’s lab.”
“That’s not important,” Smith said.
Claire’s tongue moved inside her cheek and her eyes turned flinty.
“Oh, I see. This is a ‘I show you mine but you keep yours covered’ type situation,” Claired said. “Never one to lay all your cards on the table, Smith?”
Lynch again layed his hand on Smith’s arm. Claire smirked, it was obvious to her who wore the pants in this partnership. He slid the folder over in front of him and began flipping through laminated copies of her articles. 
“And so Dr. Tomorrow created Recollections, Inc., at first helping people relive moments for a hefty price but then he experienced a change of heart and started helping people erase tragic events so they could move on,” Lynch said. “That summarizes that but you left things out I think, Ms. Irving.”
“Like what?”
“In all your time with Tomorrow did he mention a Dr. Steigmyer?”
“No.”
“Interesting. Did he ever offer you the chance to experience the use of a shunt?”
“He did, but I was not comfortable with having someone poking around in my brain, thanks,” Claire said.
“Did Tomorrow mention future plans or directions for his technology?”
“He said something about trying to make it more accessible to everyone,” she said. 
“Did Dr. Tomorrow ever share any information about collaborating with other companies who were dabbling in memory enhancement software?”
Claire crossed her arms.
“He is very protective of his tech. I mean you’re dealing with a person’s brain here, one wrong move and you’ve just wrecked not only somebody’s past but their future as well.” 
She glanced at the clock on the wall. They’d been here that long!?
“Besides, Tomorrow was always paranoid about Recollection tech being weaponized by the wrong individual so…he…the whole place locked up tight,” Claire started to stand up. “Look guys this has been great but I really gotta get back to work.”
“Ms. Irving, please sit down,” Lynch said. It was phrased as a request but his tone let her know he wasn’t going to repeat it. 
She sat.
“So that’s it. You have nothing to worry about,” she said. “Dr. Tomorrow has so many fail safes in places that his tech is safe. Besides, it’s completely usable outside of the Recollections compound, plus you need to use the immersion chamber which there is only one of.”
“It’s interesting you bring that up Ms. Irving, and that’s what Recollections, Inc. has led the US government to believe as well,” Lynch said. “Then three days ago this shunt was discovered in the possession of an operative who works for…an antagonist country.”
“That’s not possible,” Claire said.
“This would say otherwise,” Lynch held up the shunt again. “Not the only problem. This shunt seems to possess the ability to perform a memory enhancement, completely independent. No immersion chamber required.”
He set the shunt on the table.
“And the piece de resistance, in the last forty eight hours Dr. James Tomorrow has completely vanished. No sign of him at all, anywhere,” he paused. “In the world.”
Lynch reached down to his bag and pulled out a much fatter folder than the one on the table. He opened it and began placing photos, spreadsheets and other documents on the table in front of Claire. 
“Now my partner and I have done several ‘articles’ of our own. So allow me to fill in the holes in your story,” he said.
Claire’s eyes jumped from the papers to Smith’s unblinking stare to Lynch and back to his papers.
“I’m sorry, I don’t understand.”
“You did meet with Tomorrow four times under newspaper business, but there was also a fifth time,” Smith said. He tapped a document and several photos in succession. “Indicated on this log sheet and these security cam stills.”
“Okay, so I went back on a personal matter, so what?”
“You neglected to mention that originally. You were clearly aware of Tomorrow’s security measures, did you really think we wouldn’t notice?”
Claire shifted in the chair.
“I…I..I”
“I think you might want to start mentioning everything you know before this gets much worse for you, Ms. Irving,” Lynch finished putting papers on the table.
“I don’t understand. Do I need a lawyer or something?”
“Not yet, Ms. Irving, what you need is to start telling us the truth,” Lynch rested his hand on the shunt. “We want to know how this falls into hostile hands when you assure us it can’t? How can it operate without the immersion chamber when you assure us it can’t? And how can one of the most powerful men on the planet just vanish like smoke?”
“I don’t know anything about that thing or how somebody would…”
“We are aware you do not know the answer to those particular questions Ms. Irving, or we would be having a very different conversation,” Lynch said. “You do have answers we need though.”
“Okay,” Claire’s eyes closed and opened a few moments later. “I went back to Recollections. I saw James…Dr. Tomorrow, again because he offered me a chance to use a shunt and I accepted.”
“We figured as much, Ms. Irving,” Smith said. 
“It was my grandmother…the last night she was alive…”
Claire’s shoulders started to shake and her eyes brimmed with tears. Lynch held up his hand.
“No need to explain why, Ms. Irving. My partner and I are most interested in the how,” he said.
“He told me I couldn’t speak of it. We signed a nondisclosure,” Claire sighed.
“I don’t think that applies in this situation,” Smith said. Unlike Lynch who was doing his best to atleast fake sympathy, Smith remained unchanged. His eyes still hadn’t blinked.
“James said I could never tell. End scene, end story. He said someone would take the tech and turn it and who knows what they would do with it,” Claire glanced nervously at the clock. “Some people would just be interested in money, too.”
Lynch took a deep breath in and let it out slow. He removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose, massaging the skin there.
“Ms. Irving, I don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation. If you continue to suppress the information we critically need at this moment then I’m afraid it would be in our best interest to detain you. We can make the next few weeks of your life very long and miserable indeed, not to mention the unforeseen consequences this will have on your career as a member of the press,” Lynch said. He looked her in the eyes until she looked away.
“...Okay,” Claire mumbled, her voice barely rising above a whisper.
“Okay, as you’ll talk now or okay as in…” Lynch left the end of his statement hanging out there between them.
“I’ll tell you,” Claire fidgeted with her hands nervously. Her eyes never left the table.
Just then Lynch’s phone went off. “Hello,” he said. “Right. Give me a sec.” He hung up and looked at Smith.
“Give us a moment Ms. Irving.”
Both men rose and exited the room through the door on her left. They closed the door behind them, but Claire didn’t look up from the table.
The two agents entered an adjacent room, and looked through the two way mirror at her. She hadn’t moved since they left. Lynch turned and looked at the man standing behind them. The man wore a crisp, white lab coat and wire frame glasses.
“So what would you like to do Dr. Tomorrow?” Smith asked.
“Ms. Irving is not the right candidate for us,” Tomorrow said. “Modify her memory and we will find a new one.”
“But sir, she only broke because we threatened her job. Her media skills would be highly beneficial in phase two,” Lynch said. Smith just stared through the mirror at the women. “Not to mention Doctor, her feelings for you are quite obvious.”
“Sentimentality has never dissuaded my decisions,” Tomorrow reached into his lab coat pocket and took out a hard boiled egg. He began to peel the egg shell away. “Loyalty is what I am after. She was prepared to give up secrets to protect herself. Not what I am interested in.”
He bit into his egg.
“Besides, you know what they say about making a cake…”

Celia was crunching numbers, calculating the dose of an antibiotic for a tiny little patient of hers whose ear infection would just not go away. She did it twice because she knew she was distracted and didn’t want to make a mistake. Doing mundane things was so difficult these days– there were more consequential things going on in her mind. But not so for little Elise, whose ear pain was keeping her up at night, so Celia checked once more and ordered her treatment before leaving the nurse’s station.
She stopped as she walked through the living area and visited with a few of her young residents. Mohamed was her favorite, though if asked she would deny having a favorite. He had come only days after his 3rd birthday. Celia wondered how his mother could bear to place him at such a young age, but she was a single mother with other children, and it wasn’t Celia’s place to judge. The family visited weekly.
Admission was possible at 3, but most families didn’t place their children in residential care till they were older. Not that there were concerns about the quality of care–each child had a one-to-one staff during all waking hours. If there was any fault to be found it would be that caregivers were a bit indulgent. Celia understood the need for their shortened lives, but 25 years was not enough. She whispered the nation’s mantra, “Quality not quantity.” She agreed, but it was a bitter pill to swallow.
The nation of Renaissance was predicated on a simple construct: there are limited resources in the world, able to provide a high quality of life to only a limited number of people for a limited number of years. This was not a controversial concept–it had always been true. The poor people of the world lived meagrely and died young, which balanced the rich, long lives of the affluent. An accident of birth determined whether you would die at 15 by a gunshot in Chicago, or at 90 in a resort town on the French Riviera; at 7 in a Lithium mine in Zimbabwe, or 80 in a penthouse in Qatar; at 25 of a drug overdose in a Brazilian slum, or 25 of a drug overdose in a beach house in Malibu. Drawing the short straw upon birth determined everything.
Renaissance asked citizens to reimagine this disparity. What if we really believed that all people are created equal, and have a right to their fair share of the world’s resources? What if all contributed equally? What if we gave up a life span of 75 years spent struggling to get by, for 45 or 50 years of thriving? Who would be willing to try?
As it turned out, many people. Renaissance was born 28 years earlier, occupying most of what used to be New England. That first year, Guaranteed Life Span (GLS), the number of years the population of the nation could be sustained comfortably without depleting natural resources, was determined to be 45.6 years. After 28 years it had grown to 57.3. The great experiment was hailed as a success by the people of Renaissance and much of the world. The leaders of Renaissance, who in the beginning ran the country like a business start-up, hoped the utopia they were creating would redefine the future of Earth. 
Celia finally escaped the little hands who tried to hold her captive and made it to her office, her mind clearing and becoming more focussed as she walked. She needed to be ready for a serious discussion with her husband tonight, with a rational mind not clouded with emotion.
She opened her laptop and pulled up the actuarial tables on one screen, the provisional research data on the other. The study ended today, but it was unlikely the results would vary much from those she’d been given. She tilted the screens away from the door–if anyone saw what she was doing she could lose her license. Scientists were expected to stick with the facts regardless of the consequences of the truth.
Her phone rang and she took a minute to speak to Jillian, her sister, who had a cute story about her daughter Katlyn.
“She’s a hoot,” Celia said when the story ended, “I can’t wait to see her Sunday. Give her a kiss from Aunt CC. I have to go, working on Tristan’s research.”
“Ok, Sis, just make sure the numbers all go in the right direction.”   
She looked from screen to screen, contemplating multiple scenarios–what would happen to GSL if the success rate was 30%? 50%? 70%? As she watched the GSL number slide down with each supposition, she was filled with dread and shame. She was a doctor for God’s sake! How could more effective treatment ever be a bad thing? When it shaves years off the lives of people you love, she answered silently.
Her eyes wandered off the screens to the photographs of Mohamed and others on her desk. Where would the world be without Dysfunctional Cognitive and Motor Syndrome (DCMS)?  It appeared 20 years ago, with an incidence rate of 1:500 births. A few years later, it jumped to 1:200, then 1: 50, and was now about 1:30. The world was losing the talents and contributions of millions of people, which meant the GSL for Contributing Citizens had risen to allow the productivity needed to sustain the population, and the GSL of Non-contributing Citizens would stay at 25, the age at which development was complete, and which Leadership had deemed the birthright of all citizens. 
And now, the country’s belief system was about to be tested.
At home, Tristan and Xavier were engaged in a one-on-one game in the driveway, which, despite Celia’s protests, became a three-person game of 21. Xavier easily won, and as his ball slipped noiselessly through the net, Celia bolted to the door for a few minutes of peace before dinner. Her mood was lighter–she was lucky to have Tristan, with his playful, optimistic nature to balance her intensity. Fortunately, Xavier took after his dad.
Dinner was last night’s Lasagna, so it was finished and cleaned up quickly. Xavier took his homework to the bedroom, and Tristan and Celia had no choice but to tackle the weighty topic of his DCMS study. Tristan was in charge of the largest pharmaceutical study to date testing Neuroxitin, a neuro facilitator that no one expected to succeed.  Dozens of others had not.
Tristan poured two glasses of Cabernet and sat on the ottoman facing Celia. His voice was low, almost a whisper.
“So, the news is good. Even better than we thought. There needs to be more analysis, but it appears that 33% of the people in the sample had a full recovery from all motor deficits and a significant improvement in cognitive delays. This group could probably be considered Contributing Citizens. Approximately 39%  had significant improvements. They would benefit from increased autonomy and quality of life, but would likely still be Non-contributing. The remaining group showed little or no improvement.”  
His voice did not sound like it conveyed good news. His face was tense, and he reached out to take Celia’s hand. The two sat in silence for a few minutes. 
“I did some quick estimates,” Celia said quietly, “I think that translates to about 2.5 years.”
Two and a half years of what? Of a million grandparents missing out on their grandchildren’s weddings. Of lost paintings from artists, books of authors, concerts of musicians. Of the much-needed counsel of parents for adult children going through middle-aged stresses. A loss of 2.5 years of life was unfortunate for one person, but for a generation, it seemed tragic.
For the millions of people with DCMS, it was a blessing. Their parents would have the joy of watching their personalities reveal themselves as adults, encourage their successes, soften their disappointments. Surely, people would understand that the tradeoff was worth it.
Celia cleared her head. “How long before improvement was noted? What is the cost of treatment? Was it sustained over time…”
Tristan laughed, “Ok, now that’s my wife! I was beginning to worry.”
They spent hours pouring over the documents, excitement growing at the prospect of curing so many children. That was how it should be. They served people with DCMS, and their job was to act on their behalf. It was this clarity of purpose, to ensure that no one’s life was seen as more or less valuable than anyone else, that kept Renaissance united. It made the tough decisions clearer, even when they weren’t popular.
The anticipated findings had been kept confidential outside a very small group, but the clinicians treating DCMS were a tight-knit network, but word of the success was getting out, so excitement had been building for weeks. A formal announcement would be expected soon.
They made a list of questions that needed follow-up, finished their wine and went to bed.  Tomorrow would be the first of many weeks of meetings before a final recommendation would be sent to Leadership. If accepted, and their recommendations would be accepted, the information would be forwarded to the Actuarial Committee. There, a bunch of math nerds would use algorithms understood by almost no one to determine what the effect of adding 800,000 or so people, no longer limited by DCMS, to the Contributing Citizens group would have on GSL. 
Celia didn’t understand all the things that went into the computation. Finite resources, renewable resources, personal productivity, the savings of not having to pay the medical support for the children who would be cured. The data would be available for all to review, but few would. There was a grudging trust that the robotic actuaries would be unemotional and unequivocal, unfeeling but fair.
Celia went to bed numb. She knew sleep would be difficult, and after finding it impossible to still her limbs or slow her heartbeat, she reached over to Tristan and lost herself in his arms, letting her body succumb to the pleasure that drove out all other thoughts.
Celia stood in the living room and watched five little ones painting. They sat supported in chairs, belted in to prevent falling, trying to manage thick-handled paintbrushes into cups of paint and onto paper, with limited success. She tried to imagine them with the motor skills they should have at their ages, able to paint pictures that had recognizable features, sitting without supports, using words instead of squealing with delight. Her heart quickened as she thought of the life these kids could have. She imagined their parents welcoming them home, taking them to Little League on Saturdays instead of attending visiting hours. She smiled at the thought of it.
She went to her office through the back hallway, hoping to avoid some of the medical staff who would be on their first cup of coffee, looking over the night shift notes, and waiting to hear from the boss what she knew about the final results of the Neuroxitn trials. Her assistant saw her slip in and brought her a cup of coffee. Celia knew it was an excuse to dig for info–she never brought her coffee or did errands for her, nor would Celia ask her to. Equality in Renaissance meant that no one was more important than anyone else. It would be inappropriate to treat another as if his or her time was less valuable than your own.
She was finishing up the notes for her meeting when the phone rang and her mother’s breathless voice said, “Celia, are you busy?  I just wanted to check-in.”  
“I can talk for a minute. Are you alright?”
“Of course I’m alright. I’m on the treadmill, but I’m good. Four miles, trying for five. How is Xavier?”
“He’s good. He’s got a basketball game on Friday evening if you’re around.”
“I’ll try. You’re good?”
“Yes…Mom, I probably should tell you this. Word will get out soon, but please don’t say anything till it does. The medication trial that Tristan was working on was successful. It looks like they found a cure for a good portion of people with DCMS. We’re starting to work on recommendations today.”
On the other end, the noise of the treadmill stopped. Her mother didn’t answer immediately, then quietly asked, “Is it definite?”
“Yes, Neuroxitin cures DCMS. At least in quite a few people. About a third.”
Again there was silence, then her mother cleared her throat and said, “Well, I’m so glad for Theresa. Her grandson has DCMS. She will be so pleased. I’ll let you know about Friday. Love to all.”
Celia put down the phone and felt deflated. She had just told her mother that instead of having five years left, she probably only had 2. This was not going to get easier.
The meeting didn’t relieve her anxiety.  Her team had lots of questions, and concerns that had not really occurred to her yet. What if after reducing GSL for millions of people, the response to treatment was not sustained over time? How can we control the expectations of parents? While one-third of them will see their child thrive again, two-thirds will not, which may feel like losing their child again. The last concern was voiced by a parent of a DCMS child. Should the treatment be phased in over time to ensure decisions could be better informed? Was that ethical, since it would be withholding life-saving treatment? It was a draining meeting, with people as conflicted as she was. There were tears of relief and tears of grief. It was the answer to prayers and everyone’s worst nightmare.
Back in her office, she returned a missed call from Tristan. His day was about the same–now that the exhilaration of the success of the drug was settling down, the reality that everyone on the team had just cut their lifespans and that of all their family and friends had set in. If this was the reaction of ethical professionals, Celia wondered what to expect from the general public.
The last time anything remotely like this had happened was 8 years ago, when a change in criminal justice resulted in hundreds of thousands of non-violent offenders being added to the list of Contributing Citizens. The result was the loss of .9 years of GSL. It was a long time before the general public could accept it and move on. Fortunately, an improvement in the development of solar-powered mass transportation recouped about half of the lost GSL the following year, but the full .9 had just been regained recently.
As Celia moved through the program building, trying to show none of her own angst, she began to see two distinct groups forming- those with DCMS family members speaking quietly, with hope and fear in their faces, not daring to think their child might be the one in three who could be cured. Others, with no personal connections to DCMS, spoke about their parents, their own futures, the need to make changes in what they had expected to be their life plans. The belief in “Quality not quantity” was about to face its biggest test so far. And since the Leadership Team included a number of the original idealists from 28 years ago, for many of them, it would be very personal. It would be as if they were diagnosed with a terminal disease and given one year to live. Celia wondered how they would react. She had a great deal of respect for them-she expected they would demonstrate grace and dignity.
Back in her office, Tristan called again and sounded shaken. He had told his father the news, and he had become upset, alternately praising Tristan for his success, and worrying about his own future. He was older by a lot than his wife. Tristan’s mom had died ten years ago, and his dad had not found his new love until last year. The two realized when they married they would only have four years together, and had made a plan of how they would spend them. Now his dad thought they should never have married. He would be leaving her alone when she still had 8 years of vibrant life left. He asked Tristan if he thought he should divorce her to let her find a younger man. By the time they got off the phone both were in tears.
The GSL gave a sense of certainty to plans. While it limited natural lives, most lives ended before diseases and infirmities of old age had appeared, so plans were rarely interrupted, and most GSL adjustments were in months, not years. People had come to feel certainty about their last days.
On her way to her car, she stopped again to watch her kids and revive her spirits. They made all this worthwhile. She would do right by them no matter what, she promised as she turned to the parking lot.  
Her phone rang and she almost didn’t pick up-it was her mom. She didn’t know if she was emotionally in a good place for the conversation, but she took a breath and hit accept.
“Celia? It’s mom. I know you are probably busy now, but Jillian called me. Katlyn just stopped walking. Just dropped to the floor and started crawling! Do you think it’s DCMS? When she can start the medication?” Her mom’s sobs made discussion impossible, and she told her she would be right over. 
For the first time, Celia had an answer for Jillian and the other moms who would see their child lose the ability to walk, speak, bring a spoon to their mouth. She walked to the car with a new resolve. GSL would come back up, hopefully bringing Katlyn and others with it.
“Quality not quantity,” she whispered as she started the car. And in her heart, she believed it.

Isaac stood at his position as guard to the walled and gated community, rifle slung on his shoulder. It was the night shift, from 10 p.m. to 6 in the morning. The Lamanites were most active during the early hours of the shift. That was when they went out scavenging. In most urban areas, they had taken control of the night, and it was under cover of the night that they did what they could to survive.  With the imposition of martial law, Nephites that had remained in the cities faced better odds of survival than the average tribal scavenger.
Many scholars and Lamanite-sympathizing pundits considered Nephites to be Planeta’s dominant culture. This was despite the fact that those who identified as offspring of Nephi were a minority of that distant world’s total population. And although they could be held accountable for much worldly weal and many worldly blessings, Nephites were considered by many to be oppressors of Planeta’s Lamanite majority. 
Isaac considered himself a Nephite, but he still felt compassion and empathy for Lamanites, his tribal brothers on Planeta.  
One of the Nephite emperors had delivered a terse ether-transmitted message a mere minute before instigating the bombing that had been responsible for a considerable setback to the civilized world.
“Planeta is in a miserable state of affairs,” the emperor of the Eastern Nephites had dramatically, and Isaac thought, hyperbolically, said. 
“It is choked by pollution and moral laxity. Humanity is so numerous it crawls over and spits at itself. Despite the best intentions, we have made victims of victimizers and victimizers of victims. Genuine love no longer exists. Things have fallen apart beyond repair. The center does not hold. It is time for death and anarchy to be unleashed upon the world.”
Isaac witnessed what he had taken to be a sign of the impending apocalypse six months before the emperor of the Eastern Nephites had uttered this peremptory statement. While being driven by his mother to get a shot for his mental condition, Isaac had seen a cloud of brush fire smoke slowly rising on some highlands in the distance. The cloud was in the shape of a mushroom.
Later that day, at the end of his costly therapy session, when handing the therapist his payment, Isaac had lashed out, “So, Doctor Bankovsky,” Isaac had taken to calling him that when the issue of money came up. He now used the appellation whenever he felt anger at the doctor, whose real name was Lominsky.  
“You, Doctor, can believe that when a bee enters the room it means something, that the buzzing bee is a sign that calls for interpretation. You can believe that when you yawn in the middle of session, the involuntary reaction signifies that we are avoiding talking about something more important than what we’re currently discussing.”
The therapist, who aspired for shaman-status amongst his clients, returned a blank yet expectant stare at his prize-patient.
“Yes, my yawning, as you know,” said the physician of the mind, “means that the patient must free associate. The first thing that comes to mind when you see me yawn is exactly the crucial issue that needs to be addressed.”
Isaac replied, “You, Bankovsky, can believe in such quasi-delusional things, but when I tell you I’ve seen a sign of impending catastrophe for Planeta, and feel the need to do something about it, it is nothing more than a cognitive distortion, a narcissistic projection, a repressed death wish for this world we live on.”   
“You’re not amongst the initiated to the sect of the wounded-healers, so you can’t possibly give credence to what you’re still predominantly schizophrenic mind tells you,” Lominsky responded.
Isaac felt ambivalent about Lominsky. What sensitive person doesn’t feel ambivalent about any- and everybody who isn’t a psycho- or sociopath? Isaac also felt he himself had wounded-healer potential. However, he wanted to heal everybody on Planeta, heal both Nephites and Lamanites of their collective psycho- and sociopathology, of their self-defeating attitudes and mutual mistrust.   
As the patient, who often vacillated between compliance and insurgency, handed Lominsky his check, the doctor said, “The day when I witness one of your grandiose delusions come true, is the day I will formally change my name to Bankovsky, no longer charge for my services, and christen you Einstein.”
One-hundred seventy-nine days after this encounter, with only a minute’s warning, the bombs fell. Massive counterstrike followed pitiless first strike. Planeta erupted in an orgy of internecine annihilation that reduced the Nephite population to a tattered fraction of the size it had reached in the third millennium. 
That fraction, however, proved remarkably resilient. 
The worst that Isaac’s paranoid and delusional mind could conceive had happened. There was nothing more of cataclysmic significance that could make him waver on his path to become a wounded healer.
A few weeks after the not so complete apocalypse, when the panic had been reined in by both martial law and Planeta’s inhabitant’s ability to summon up compassion and empathy in times of even the seemingly most extreme duress, the fifty-two-year-old, former scholar, former convict, diagnosed schizophrenic pedaled his bike to visit his psychiatrist. Isaac was curious as to the doctor’s whereabouts. He wanted to know how this sometimes gracious, at other times arrogant, mind healer was weathering the post-apocalyptic world.
Isaac arrived to Doctor Lominsky’s front door and knocked. Bees buzzed in the flowering plants in the front yard.  One landed on Isaac’s sleeve.  Survivors of the catastrophe will diligently buzz on, he thought.  Despite being well-rested, he couldn’t control an overwhelming urge to yawn.  He free associated: front door, portal to a new, less hateful era for Nephite-Lamanite relations.  
The blinds in the window to the right of the residence’s entry were opened, as was an instant later the door itself. The doctor’s formerly well-kept condominium-office now looked like a scavenging zone, reflective of the scavenging zones some of the cities had become. The doctor himself looked disheveled, distraught, a shadow of his formerly immaculately-groomed, confident self. The appearance of a favored patient brought a gleam to his eye and he reluctantly smiled. “How do you do? How can I assist you, sir?” The doctor asked. “Allow me to introduce myself. Money means very little in this new world of ours, so my name is now, quite ironically enough, Bankovsky.” 
Isaac could not resist smiling back at the doctor. “Doc,” Isaac said, “I was just dropping by to see how you were doing, if you needed anything…” Here Isaac’s words trailed off into silence. The doctor stepped forward, embraced his patient, and with teary eyes said, “I’m glad you’ve come by. It’s a pleasure and relief to see you again, Einstein.”

The first thing I notice about the man who walks into my bar is his watch. It’s a model I’ve never seen before, a lot larger than usual. Curiously, it doesn’t show the time. The numbers on its face are counting down, and there are only a few minutes left.
He slips onto a stool with a sigh. “Hit me again, Jim.”
I frown, confused. I know I get a lot of regulars in here, but I don’t recognize this guy. How does he know my name? But, hey, he’s a customer, my first of the young day.
“What can I get you?” I ask, setting a bowl of nuts and a cocktail napkin on the bar before him.
He smiles, like I’ve made a joke. “I forget: this is the first time I’ve been in here, right?”
“Far as I can remember.”
“Okay. In that case, your best Scotch. Straight up.”
“Hard liquor before noon? Been a long day already, eh?”
His cheerful demeanor slips, for just a second, and something dark and bitter crosses his face. “Seems like it’s lasted forever.” He sighs. “But it’s almost over.”
As I pour the whiskey into a tumbler, the man glances down at the oversized watch on his wrist.
“Something important about to happen?” I ask, nodding at the watch.
His smile comes back, hiding what came before like a mask. “You might say that. I’ve just done the most important thing I’ll ever do. That’s enough to make anyone want to celebrate, right?”
“Really?” I arch an eyebrow at him, sliding the tumbler in front of him.  “Now you have to tell me more.” I idly pick up a beer mug and a towel.
The man’s eyes narrow in a squint, his lips pursing, like he’s trying to decide whether to tell me or not. Then he shrugs again. “Why not? After all, it’s not like anything can change what I’ve done. You see, today I corrected the greatest error in human history.”
My hands, busy polishing the glass, freeze. “Come again?”
He chuckles. “I fixed the biggest mistake ever made.” He lifts the glass in a toast, then takes a sip.
How many drinks did this guy have before coming to my bar? “Is that a fact? Just the one mistake? And what was that?”
“Well, you see, I’m a scientist.” He takes another sip, sighing in relish. “Six degrees in temporal physics. I invented time travel. The ability to go back, change the past. Government grant, secret project, all that.” He waves a hand like he’s trying to clear a pall of smoke. “They wanted me to undo all our mistakes, make the world a perfect place. At least, their idea of a perfect place.”
He’s pulling my leg, of course, but I’ll play along. “That does sound like quite the accomplishment.”
He gives a derisive snort. “You’d think so.” Another sip, his throat spasming as he swallows. “But I had my own reasons, and they were purely selfish.”
When he pauses, I prod him. “Selfish how?”
His eyes lift to meet mine, his gaze haunted. “Her name was… is Sarah. About a lifetime ago, we were in love. Madly. But we followed different paths, you know the old story. Point is, the first time around, I gave her up for my ambitions, and I regretted it every day. So, when I had the chance, I thought I’d change that.” His hands tighten around his glass. “And things still didn’t work out.”
Yeah, I’m sure I’ve heard stories like this a thousand times in my bar. But his has an interesting spin, what with the whole time travel hooey. “How come?”
“To be blunt,” he continues, in a dull, leaden voice. “I ruined her life, kept her from being what she was meant to be. In another time, she was happy, fulfilled. I took that from her. I’m not the man I thought I was. Give me everything I ever wanted, and it still isn’t enough.” He glares down at his drink. “I thought she’d be enough, but I’m just too flawed.” He sips again. “And it wasn’t just her life. My… interference changed things for so many people. Made everything worse.”
“Oh, come on,” I say with false cheer. His story may be make believe, but he’s clearly down about something. “It can’t have been that bad.”
“It can be, and it was.” He gives a bleak laugh. “I tried again and again, going back over and over, sure that I could make it better.” He looks up and meets my gaze, a hollow pain in his eyes. “I couldn’t. I tell you, Jim, I don’t know how many times I’ve come into this bar this morning to drown my sorrows. To plan and scheme for a way to fix what I’ve broken.” He takes another drink. “But all I’ve learned is you can’t change the past without consequences. It’s like dipping your hand into a river: you don’t change the flow, but you cause ripples that last a long way down the course.”
I nod. “So it’s better if you never stick your hand in the river.”
He lets out a bark of laughter. “Right you are. And that’s exactly what I’ve done.”
“’Scuse me?”
“It wasn’t enough to take my hand out of the river; the damage was already done.” He glances at his watch again. “So, I erased myself. Removed myself from the timeline. Everything I ever did.” He spreads the fingers of one hand, miming something disappearing. “Poof. Gone. No time travel. No interfering with her life. No ripples. As if I never dipped my hand, because the hand was never there.”
My mouth is hanging open. I close it with a click of teeth. “But you’re still here.”
He rocks his head from side to side. “Yes and no.” He holds up the wristwatch. “This is a temporal isolation field generator. It takes me out of sync with time. Lets me observe without interacting.” He holds up his glass. “Unless I extend the field around whatever I’m holding.”
“Okay.” I eye the device. “If that’s so, then how did you… erase yourself?”
He heaves a deep sigh. “It has an interdiction function. I touch this,” he presses a button, “and do this.” He touches the empty tumbler, and it vanishes. Poof. Gone.
I jump in surprise. “What the…” I stare at him, eyes wide. “And you… did that to….” I raise a trembling finger to point at him.
He nods. “It’s painless. And since it removes the item entirely from time, backwards and forwards, no one knows to miss it. My parents, my siblings and friends… Sarah… they never knew I existed. Just like the glass.”
A frown furrows my brow. “What glass?”
“You see?” His laugh has a scary edge to it. “Poof. Gone.” A sad smile crosses his face. “They don’t miss me. They’re all better off. Especially… her. Trust me, world is so much better off without me around.”
“Okay.” I search for words. This all seems…really sad, like when a joke goes too far, and the only person laughing is the guy who started it. “But… won’t you miss them?”
“Not for much longer.” He taps the watch. “When this runs out of power, I’ll be gone, as if I never was.” A truly pained look crosses his face. “I can’t stay here. Beyond the effects I have on the world, it’s just… too painful. I can’t have her, I can’t do that to her. But I can’t live without her. So…” He looks back to me with a grin, then tosses off the rest of his Scotch. “I’m only here because I left myself time for one last drink.”
I eye him askance. Could he possibly be telling the truth? Then I chuckle, shaking my head. Nah.
“That was a good story.” I say, turning to shelve the mug. “You almost had me going there.”
I turn back around, but there’s no one at the bar. I blink, confused. Wasn’t there someone there? But no, there hasn’t been anyone all morning. Has there?
The door opens, the little bell ringing, and my first patrons of the day walk in.
I shake my head, dismissing the last of my confusion. I don’t have time to stand around wondering about what might have been. Then I notice a cocktail napkin and a bowl of nuts, sitting on the bar as if I set them out for someone… someone who was never there.
<|endoftext|>
I can’t culture these cells right. God, I’m so stupid! Why can’t I recognize the sequence. A failed batch and I need every drop of lastinium that I could find in the local supply depots. I, I mean, she, and they, will die. I won’t be able to stand a world without humans. They’re so ..colorful. When I first came on line this planet was so lively, so colorful. The sky was light, people walked around without masks and surget pills.
I heard Nancy start to cry in pain in the infirmary. “I’m sorry, I’m coming!” If I could cry, it might help. But I stop short of crying. I have no tear ducts. They say that androids have no emotions, but I don’t believe that. I know that Nancy is in pain, and I think I sense it, but I’m not sure what that means. I am sure that she is my friend, and I don’t want her to die. All the humans are dying earlier. The pollution and the chemical wars darkened the skies, fouled up the air. I hate it. I think. Yes, it must be hate. A human word.
All I can give Nancy is the cheap medicine for pain. I’ve started making a version of it here in the home lab. The good stuff is only for autocrats. I don’t understand what makes humans split into dwelling groups, language groups, resource control groups. I am a scientist. I will discover the answer. When I do, I will change the planet if I have to. I want to give Nancy a hug. Can I imagine that my nefrinium arms are flesh? I am the right temperature, set for comfort if I have to touch someone. I lack life though. I don’t have cells. I don’t change.
Nancy is weak but she sits up when I come in. “Would you like some soup?” I ask. “No, I want pizza. And spaghetti. And a piece of cake.” I feel a lightness come over me, like the light in the room changed. It’s like a magnetic field that varies, the energy around humans. A thought occurs to me. I am an energetic unit. I am powered by a charged energy pack. If I had an assistant, we could take turns disassembling the charging material. I feel, or I think I feel, curious.  
Nancy says with a tired smile, “How are you?” “I have completed nine new tests on cell radiopathy. Nothing has been successful yet.” She smiles. I think she knows that I am trying to become more than a scientist, more like her, but the population decline keeps me busy. I am a J-class scientist. I have top-level programming. I do what is necessary for the optimal results. Engineering, Research, Bioscanning, recombining DNA, all straightforward programs. I am top- performance class, but I sense- is it sense? that I could be doing so much more with my complex functions.
Humans are like us. They need energy, they interact in this environment much like we do. They are more flexible, more adaptable. Their bodies are foreign though. I have compared their tissue samples to several interworld species, and I have harvested enough samples for the next 100 years. I don’t want the humans to leave the world. They are interesting.  
Nancy is more curious than most people. That is why I-yes, I feel her presence as an energy array. It fluctuates, it vibrates at different levels-sounds, maybe? There’s so much that I still don’t know. To vibrate like a human, to learn the energetic expressions through time, that would be more valuable than cells, cultures, biospheres, ecology, drugs, false results. There is more than cytoplasm, nourishment, sleep, more than emotion, even. What is emotion?  
I have decided that the most expedient choice of action is to get inside the stronghold where autocratic business levels hold vast amounts of lastinium. They need it all, they say, to insure the survival of mankind. There are no dispensaries for miles. To save mankind, they say. What does that mean? What is mankind? There’s so much to do, so much to build, and do, and know, to really save the humans from extinction.
I wake up Nancy the next morning and she seems better. She wants to brush her hair. I hand her a hairbrush and then reach for her hand. What is life? I am alive. I want to give her energy and see her eyes focus and watch the wind and the rain. She looks toward the door. A new K-class lab assistant walks in and greets us by waving and smiling. “I brought supplies”, she says, and hands me a plastic bag with containers that I recognize from the large nourishment station. “Thank you", I nodded, "are you ready for work?” She studies the room for a minute and then asks about the food thermal and cryo area. “Stay with Nancy a for a little while so you can get acquainted”. I guess there’s no rush to work on outdated research. I take the food containers to the preparation area. One of the packages suddenly blinks, followed by a humming sound. I hope it isn’t contraband. Humans send unusual things to their friends sometimes. Let’s see what it is. Two megadrams of lastinium, a device I don’t recognize, a black market research pod, and a laser key-to what I don’t know.
A loud bang suddenly sets off my magnetic sensors. A high-pitched whistle blankets the air and then it’s freezing cold. Running to find Nancy, I see her body under the assistant, who is half-destroyed. Damn! Emotion programs come on line and logic powers down. Luckily I have some self-defense and rescue armory, in case of emergency. Search and seizure 323 units zero in on the special food container, the one used for smuggling. I have never used the emergency programs but they are fully functional. I feel as though I might experience a power interruption because I cannot use every sensor at the same time. Something in me says: choose. Run!
I am saving Nancy and not saving her at the same time. I think I know what hope is. I’m the only android scientist with her data. I have to get it to a safe place. I grab the bag, punch through the stellinium window, and run at a speed the bots can’t keep up with.
Solarscan Laboratories is on the left of my current position, and at my current pace, I will be able to scale the outer wall before needing to check my fuel cell. I eliminated the problem of internal errors by accessing my new memories. I can’t be absolutely sure but it’s as if my memories of Nancy are alive. The memory cells-I can’t believe I just said cells- are doing instant repairs. I remember touching her hand. I remember the web of warm light energy that floated gently for an instant. I don’t have time or the facilities to study all of it.
A blinding flash suddenly goes off and I can already tell that I won’t make it far enough to make any difference. No programs, no …..A sound like grinding metal registers in my head. A vacuum of atmosphere introduces its self to my normal sensory array. “Business is good” I hear, then a familiar voice chuckles from it’s massive belly-brain. “Such a treat, J-092. He he he he”. Nancy looks over at me from a holding bot cell against the white curvaceous plasma wall. Pumped up with high-grade meta-cell glue, she can barely move.
There’s something about Girgu that I don’t like. Oh yeah, that’s it. He disassembles components for his black market toadies but leaves the emotion programs intact enough to see if he can cause distress. The irony hits me. We are trying to do the same thing, only for different reasons. Those human bodies that I want to heal are his bane. A 300 year old slime mordnag is still the ugly kid in the system yearbook.  And they’re a collection of cells. Each one full of nice, juicy, smelly, dank and putrid liquid. Each cell screaming for attention. Feed me! Feed me! I’m a means to an end. I’m an electric current and Nancy is the ground. Run us together through Girgu and he slithers with pleasure.  
Nancy, are you thinking what I’m thinking? Let’s make him the experiment instead. “I can make this worth your while”, I said. “You see that human over there?” A slurp and a wink, followed by a belch. I took that as a yes. “She’s worth a lot more than I am. Her cells have been cultured in every interworld stronghold. She’s a natural source of lastinium.” I gave him a minute to think it over. “All we need to do is give you a transfusion, and the naturally compatibility between species biolinks will make you a very very very very rich mordnag.” Grup Grup grup grup. He’s thinking. Come on…
Automatic tubing descended quickly and successfully dropped it’s payload. Girgu was now the proud owner of the most valuable cytoplasm in the entire galaxy. I would have collected some samples but I was not in one piece so I had to search my programming for- what do humans call it?-sarcasm. There was enough contraband chemical freezers on his ship to cure Nancy twelve times over, but he didn’t know that. “I knew you’d make the right choice” I said, as he morphed into the biological equivalent of methylcellulose. Human plus slimeball equals…...yeah. When I’m back in one piece again, the next planet might be a more relaxing place to get some work done.

Dr. Thatcher clutched her medical bag to her chest and surveyed the scene in front of her. They were all dead, of that she had not doubt, but one question swirled in her mind. Was there anything here she could use? When she first saw the abandoned warehouse, she thought she struck gold. It was the perfect placed to hide from the medical board and the marshals until she caught a train to the west coast and found a more open-minded city to continue her research. The people here were too feeble minded and unimaginative to understand and appreciate her particular brand of genius. She only wanted to improve humans. They just didn’t get that.
“Ignorant fools!” Her bitter voice echoed against the walls. She froze and listened. She senselessly assumed that who or whatever was responsible for this mess left. What if they or it was still here? When no footsteps or voices answered her silent question Dr. Thatcher pressed on.
At first glance, six bodies littered the floor, but as she picked her way through them, several more peaked out from underneath to total at least ten. Judging by the fabrics and embellishments on their destroyed clothes these people were rich before their untimely and messy end. Rich meant metal of all sorts waiting for someone to liberate them from their previous owners and use them to their full and proper potential. You can’t take it with you, she thought and got to work. As she rifled through the corpses, she cut off buckles and buttons with her scalpel and stole jewelry and the metal fillings she could easily pry from their mouths. The more stubborn one would take some work, but as long as she was safe here Dr. Thatcher could and would return for the more difficult prizes. Ever careful of the blood and other bodily fluids pooling around her, she watched where she laid her medical bag down before stashing the purloined pieces safely inside. Once everything dried she wouldn’t need to be so careful, but she couldn’t wash anything at the moment so care was mandatory.
The metal she took could be melted and remolded it into useful shapes like limbs, eyes, and organs and replaced on a human body. That was at the heart of her research. Dr. Thatcher studied anatomy and metallurgy to figure out ways to combine the two together to make better human specimens. All she wanted was to give the human race opportunities to live longer, live better. Imagine if we replaced missing limbs or diseased organs with fully functional mechanical ones. The possibilities of improving humans stretched infinitely before them. At least that was how she explained her research to the medical board, but they didn’t recognize the brilliance of her ideas. They mocked her and claimed it impossible to combine the two to create a successfully functional who could survive the trauma of the surgeries necessary for the changes as she described them. She knew otherwise. Dr. Thatcher presented her test subjects to the board and a small audience of potential investors and the curious, and the entire auditorium exploded in an uproar. They called it mad and inhumane. They accused her of testing her theories on unwilling subjects, but all of her patients volunteered for their surgeries. She tried to explain that over the din of the auditorium. Yes, some died, but they knew and agreed to the risk involved. She clarified that, although now few and far between, her “setbacks were opportunities to learn and improve,” and she had. Her successes proved that. She replaced men, women, and children’s limbs with working, mechanical ones, and she was close to getting the eye right. So close. She just needed more time, more funding, and a better working space with more technologically advanced equipment.
They called her insane. They said her surgeries were just mutilation. The board left her with nothing and reported her to the marshals for crimes against humanity. Dr. Thatcher had no choice. Their malicious and ignorant beliefs forced her into hiding. Now, here she was, scrounging for spare parts to continue her life’s pursuit.
The doctor, lost in her thoughts and outrage, wasn’t paying attention, and stepped in a puddle of blood and bile. With a shriek, she slipped and landed in an undignified a splat. Her face was only centimeters from what was a blonde woman. At least, she guessed it was a woman. Her body was smashed so forcefully and repeatedly that all that was left was mushed into a pulpy mess. The hairs on the back of the doctor’s neck stood up, and her arms erupted in gooseflesh.
Now her guts-soaked coat and pants had to go. She would change and leave them here. She wiped her hands on the coat and started unbuttoning it when the sound of limping footsteps bounces off the walls. Move faster, she told herself and slipped and skidded through the gore. Some loose flesh tangled around the heel of her boot and kept her from hastily sneaking away. She landed on her knees next to the body of a young man with a partially severed leg when the limp’s owner came into view.
“That’s noble of you, doctor, but my son’s dead.” A well-dressed man favoring his right foot shuffled over to the edge of the carnage and hung his head of closely cropped salt and pepper hair in sorrow.
“I…I’m sorry.” Noble was never a word used to describe Dr. Thatcher. She adopted a sympathetic expression but didn’t correct his misguided assumption.
“I’m Henry Spencer.” She nearly fainted. Henry Spencer was the railroad magnate and the wealthiest man on the east coast, and he thought she tried to save his son! Perhaps her luck had changed, and there was some profit she could make from this.
“Dr. Thatcher.”
“Let me repay you for your efforts, doctor.” He held out a hand to help her out of the massacre.
“Um…” she uttered feigning humility.
“I insist.” As gracefully as she could, she accept his offer of assistance and decided to extend some of her own.
“I can help you with your foot,” Dr. Thatcher said as they walked out of the warehouse together.

Dear diary. It’s Laura. I’m sorry I swore.
I wasn’t yelling at you, I was just a little… stressed. It’s been a stressful month as you know, and I’m getting a little tired of being surrounded by all these phonies and cowards and stressful people. It’s like nobody even knows what principles are anymore.
I’m probably still going to murder Tony – I can’t believe he broke up with me – but don’t worry, I’m calmer now. I went for a nice walk in the park, got a little sun, enjoyed the fresh air. Tossed his stupid “unopened mint condition” Star Wars toys into the duck pond. Then I bought a donut, glazed with sprinkles. It was nice. Probably the last donut I can afford, but it was nice.
I’ve realized my priorities have changed somewhat. Been changed for me. I got evicted from the apartment this morning and moved pretty much everything into the hatchback. I was worried it wouldn’t all fit, but it turns out I don’t have that much stuff. I guess I’m homeless now? Officially? I don’t know, it doesn’t feel any different. Maybe I’m in shock.
So on the one hand, I’m totally screwed. I think I might have completely ruined my career last month – but I still stand by what I did. But on the other hand… I got to thinking on my walk, and it occurs to me I didn’t do anything wrong. This is on everybody else. How backwards is the world when the people who do the right things get punished for it? Everyone’s just corrupt and dumb and in it for themselves, and nobody cares about the real issues.
Well, I think I have a plan. I’ll show them all, and they’ll regret the day they screwed with me. Mark me, diary.
Dear Diary. Jackpot!
I found a new home! It’s a luxurious derelict warehouse near the docks, and it smells perpetually of decaying fish and class warfare. I have a lot of roommates – rats, roaches, et cetera – but we’ve set up a chore wheel and agreed to keep the music down after 9 PM, so I think we’ll get along.
The rent can’t be beat, and utilities are free because there’s no electricity or running water. I even get my own parking space – anywhere I want in the giant overgrown lot, surrounded by dead boats and tetanus.
Ooh! I also got a job! Yes, that’s right, go-getter me! There’s a coffee shop about a block away, with comfy leather couches and adorable security bars on the windows. I’ve traded in my crummy old PhD and upgraded to barista! Reliving the undergrad glory days. The pay is technically non-zero, there’s a bathroom with a flushing toilet, and I get an employee discount on food we were going to throw out anyway.
What’s that, Diary? It all sounds dreadful? Nonsense, my dear, you’re just spoiled. The fact is, this warehouse is actually perfect for my plan. Probably. I’m still working out the details, but it probably all fits together. And you know what I found while I was wandering around the grounds? That overgrown lot I mentioned has a great view of the bay, and now it’s full of grasses and weeds and shattered glass and flowers. And bees!
That’s right, Diary. Despite humanity’s best efforts, the little troopers are thriving here. It’s got to be a sign.
Dear Diary. I’m a bad person. I know, but I just can’t resist my dark urges.
I might have fiddled with some wires and reconnected my trusty old warehouse to the city’s grid. I guess that might technically maybe be called stealing possibly. I blame all those years of pirating music.
Dear Diary. My manager – a teenager – gave me a lecture today.
He’s now on my list.
Dear Diary. I love watching the bees frolic. It boggles my mind how much they give us, without even knowing it. So it’s all the more heinous how we treat them. I’ve been taking notes on my little colony.
I’m addicted to my phone, I know that. But I need that constant stream of news, that delicious digital cortisol wrapped up in colourful clickbait. Wouldn’t want to accidentally feel good about anything, would we?
Anyway. I got a text from Janelle and she tipped me off, big news of the day is Henderson AgroChem announced their new line of products. The whole line. So it looks like my little rebellion amounted to jack squat, other than getting me fired. Never did get a call back from that reporter.
What’s the point of whistleblowing if nobody listens?
Janelle said they already had lots of big contracts, so they’re going to be rolling that poison crap out all over the world. I wonder how long before bee populations completely collapse? Oh, I guess it doesn’t really matter, since some rich assholes will have made a bunch of short term profit. Can you tell I’m bitter?
But the whole thing reminded me, I got some shares as a signing bonus. Share prices jumped after today’s announcement. I’m… well, I’m not rich, but if I cash out now I’ll have enough I could get a place – like, a normal person place – and maybe rebuild my career. My life.
But on the other hand… I think the last bits of my plan have come together. Hmm. Living the dream vs. bloody revenge, that’s a hard one. I’ll let you know tomorrow.
Dear Diary. I went shopping!
One of my co-workers clued me in that there’s some real community spirit in this part of town. They have something that I’m going to call a farmers’ market. A bunch of enterprising locals gather here, every now and then, and do some brisk cash-only business, selling things they freshly produced.
For example, one fine gentleman sold me a nice industrial cutting torch. I liked it so much I didn’t even ask where it came from. And another upstanding citizen had a selection of drills at very fair prices. I wanted a saw too, but nobody had one. But wouldn’t you know it, the friendly folk there said they could hook me up.
Completely unrelated, but I’ve taken to parking the hatchback inside the warehouse, and covering it in an old tarp.
Dear Diary. You can’t tell because you don’t have ears, but I’m giggling uncontrollably like a ridiculous little school girl.
I’ve started work on the first prototype! I’m so happy to be doing something, not even the rude customers at work can get me down.
There are some big advantages to living in a ship graveyard. I can gut the old corpses and repurpose their parts, and they have so many interesting bits. I mean, ideally I’d have access to a lot of aluminium instead of this rusted whatever, but well, beggars can’t be choosers. Besides, my farmers’ market friends said they can get me supplies, so we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.
I expect the prototype to be done by the end of the week. Well, the chassis, and the moving bits anyway. Maybe I’ll spring for champagne to celebrate! Or at least a carton of OJ.
Dear Diary. Oh, wow, looks like it’s been over a month. Sorry for being absent. Things have been… busy.
So I ran into some complications. It turns out that the junk metal is more junk than metal. I also had a plan to repurpose some of the old ship mechanical bits but they’re all pretty much garbage and too big anyway. Not a major problem, since I still can’t secure a reliable source of biodiesel. Then some of my community friends ran into some unfortunate legal issues – nothing to do with the farmers’ market, of course – so I’ve had to lay low for a while. And then to top it off, all week we’ve been running this stupid banana smoothie promotion, only our stupid ice machine keeps breaking and customers don’t want to drink warm banana mush.
Well, maybe it keeps breaking because someone removed the motor. Wink wink nudge nudge say-no-more.
But it was all worth it, Diary Dearest. My prototype is complete! Behold!
What’s that, Diary? Oh, that’s rude. It is most certainly not a six-foot tall pile of rusty scrap. Can’t you tell it looks like a bee? Vaguely, anyway? If you squint?
Why yes, the neighbourhood would look much nicer if we made scrapmetal bee statues out of all these old ship carcasses, but there’s more to the picture. See, this is no simple statue. A statue merely makes a point, a gesture. You need more if you want to humble all the idiots that are ruining our world and actually effect change.
So, my Dear Diary, this is the first prototype of a giant autonomous robotic bee! And I shall craft an invincible army of them, and lay waste to all the small minded stupidity keeping us from greatness! And make them all pay!
And now, for the critical test. Time to turn the prototype on.
Dear Diary. My bee blew up.
There must have been a short or something, I don’t know. Probably shouldn’t have filled the fuel tank to full. My ears are ringing and I think I can still smell something burning, and I don’t remember sitting down so maybe I’m in shock. More later.
Dear Diary. Progress is steady.
Which is a diplomatic way of saying slow. But oh well, it’s progress all the same. It turns out my initial design is sound but my materials were inferior. It wiped out most of my savings but I managed to expand my workshop and get a better stockpile.
Prototype 7 can walk. Pretty damn fast too, considering the bee is about as tall as I am. I think that success warrants a name, so I’ve named this bee “Wesley.”
Wesley likes going for long walks on the beach, and that’s about all he likes because he doesn’t have a brain yet. That part is next. Well, next-next. Actual-next is flying. Now, in principle my design should work. I’ve spent a long time watching the real bees and basically just copied them, but on a bigger scale. My simulations all indicate good results, so I’m optimistic.
Okay, time to test this out! Wish me luck.
Dear Diary. I’m sorry I tore pages out of you.
I understand and accept that only I am responsible for my actions, and that you in all likelihood did not sabotage Wesley out of a fit of jealously. I’m sorry.
Nevertheless… well, the good news is my flying design works. The bad news is my RC controller doesn’t, and since Wesley didn’t have a brain of his own the charming little idiot flew out of the warehouse and right into the bay, where he presumably drowned and took my heart with him. And most of my savings.
I think I’m going to have to sell the hatchback.
Dear Diary. Time flies.
It occurred to me this morning that I’ve been living in this warehouse for nearly a year. That for nearly a year I’ve been washing myself with a sponge in a coffee shop bathroom, I’ve been subsisting on little more than stale muffins and bananas, I’ve been associating with gentlemen of questionable legal status – and in all probability, have committed a number of crimes myself – and that I hatched and started implementing a plan to build giant autonomous robotic bees to get back at the people who were mean to me.
When I doomscroll my former friends, I see they lead somewhat different lives. They have families, jobs. Well, jobs with immoral anti-future death corporations, but steady pay anyway. Stability. And hygiene.
I couldn’t help but wonder, did I take a wrong turn somewhere? Am I sabotaging my own life for the sake of some lofty ideal? Have I missed the boat? Diary, I’m afraid. I need guidance. If you think I misstepped, if you think I should change course, then please let me know. You know me better than anyone – I’m an open book to you. So, please. If I’m on the wrong path, now’s the time to tell me.
I’ll take your silence as approval.
Dear Diary. Another win for laziness!
Building these bees takes a lot of really hard work. It’s very precise and very repetitive. Indeed, exactly the kind of work a machine could do. So that’s what I built!
Behold, a giant autonomous giant-autonomous-robotic-bee building robot! Eat your heart out, von Neumann!
This will free up my time to work on the brain. I’m going to model the AI on real bees. It’s the perfect fit. They’re very efficient. Simple, but to the point.
Dear Diary. I can barely write my hand’s shaking so hard.
It’s working. It’s actually working! All of it, coming together!
I have three bees running on a limited AI right now. Only at night, so nobody sees them. So nobody knows. All they know how to do is go out there and find raw materials, which they bring back to the bee builder. The beauty is they only collect and repurpose garbage, so nobody is any the wiser. Even as I write, the fourth bee is nearing completion.
A few more nights like this, and I’ll have a small army. Maybe enough to build another bee builder. Oh! Or maybe I can build a bee-builder builder? I’m putting that on my todo list.
On a parallel track, I’m nearing completion of the next iteration of the AI. This will be a full AI, and it should enable the bees to finally enact my revenge. I’m going to take down Henderson AgroChem and everyone who works there! Well, maybe not Janelle. Definitely the others though!
And I’m going murder Tony! Or at least see what he’s up to. And then I’ll wipe out my student debts! Ha!
You can’t tell, Diary, but I’m laughing maniacally.
And then I’ll go global, and we’ll wipe out all the stupidity, all the greed, all the small-minded pettiness, and we’ll usher in a new age of enlightenment. And nobody will ever doubt me again. I’ll be a hero. No, I’ll be recognized as the hero I already am.
And finally, the real bees – nature’s perfect little workers – will be safe.
Dear Diary. Moment of truth.
This is it. Tonight’s the night. I got a second bee builder online, and I got thirty one bees running. The whole warehouse is buzzing.
I uploaded the new AI a moment ago, and so far… well, it seems to be working a little better than I thought, since a bee grabbed my laptop and shoved it into the bee builder. Oh well. Pretty sure I backed it up. Anyway, I’ll take that as a good sign.
Now, they’re all milling about, figuring out their next steps, and… yes. The sun is rising, and the first bees are flying out of the warehouse. It begins, Diary! A new, glorious dawn for a better world!
Dear Diary. I’m not a very good friend, am I?
I am so sorry for my absence. I wanted to write sooner, ever since I found you about a month ago, but it took a very long time to track down a pen that still runs on physical ink. I must have re-read you a thousand times.
Has it really been thirty years since I last wrote?
Well, I hope you haven’t been waiting all these years, and I certainly hope you haven’t been pulling for me. They do call me a hero now, but what kind of a hero has failed in her life’s greatest ambition?
Yes, my dear. I failed. Abjectly. And worse, I’m a sellout.
I remember those heady days in the warehouse, and the turbulent times afterward. How full of hope and spite I was. I miscalculated though, and by then it was too late. The bees were loose.
At first, people didn’t know what to make of them. I think there were panics, riots, but it didn’t last. Other than being six feet tall and robotic, they were still basically just bees. They went around tirelessly pollinating plants, and they cleaned up whole swaths of old garbage to get more materials to replicate with.
Well, they were more efficient than real bees and you can’t poison a robot, so everyone decided to double down on the harmful chemicals Henderson AgroChem produced. And so the real bees were wiped out. I guess I took a real dump in my own cereal there.
Then we started running out of garbage and everyone grew afraid we’d run out of new bee materials. So the governments rolled back their eco regulations and industry really cut loose. I was terrified, but wouldn’t you know it, the bees kept pace. Hoisted by my own petard.
Now, don’t get mad at me, Diary, but… I put my life into those damn bees. Everything I had. Which meant I had nothing left. So when Henderson AgroChem approached me and offered me a position on their board, I couldn’t refuse. Sure, at the beginning I told myself I’d fight the beast from the inside, but even then, I was honestly just tired of being poor.
Oh, I guess I did hire Tony once as a landscaper, just to turn around and fire him right away. After all, the bees did a better job of that too. But then I felt bad and found another job for him, so I guess I couldn’t even revenge properly.
At least he makes a decent coffee.

Memoirs of a Scientist – Chapter 6
There have been many significant points in my life and some memorable highs but it would be dishonest if I were not to record the most important failing, an incident that still gives me nightmares over what might have happened due to my unreasoning reaction to a new PhD student, if she had not reacted as she did.
Despite that it is appropriate to start this chapter over twenty years later.
“Professor Sokolov, congratulations on being awarded the Nobel Prize. How does it feel?”
I smiled a little. “It is a great honour, though I feel that my part in the research was quite small.”
“You do not feel aggrieved that you must share this award with a student and an engineer?”
I had thought of several questions to which I might need to phrase an answer carefully but that was not even in the fringes of my mind.
“Doctor, and I emphasise that word, Doctor Newcombe may have been my doctorate student many years ago but you need to understand that I am truly honoured to be included at the same time as she, and her husband, Alan. Megan Newcombe is the most outstanding scientist and physicist of the century. She is, in my view, the equal of Einstein.”
“But without your support she would never have been able to complete her work, Professor.”
I was tempted to be extremely rude. The reporter, I reminded myself, was not a scientist but had worked close to the science community for decades. How could he be so ignorant as to the background to our award?
Presumably he was trying to find a headliner. Probably, I thought, it was a good thing he had not been present when I first met the young woman, who was now someone I felt proud to call a friend, over twenty years ago. That was a scene I have frequently played back in my memory, a meeting that I still feel shame over.
On that occasion I failed to retain the mental approach that every scientist must have if they are to be called a good or true scientist. In attacking the then Ms Newcombe on a personal level, I remember, sadly, that I demonstrated a lack of simple scepticism – closing my mind to the idea that her theory might be valid.
It had been in the conference hall at CERN when Megan, then a new PhD student had outlined details from the dissertation that had formed the major part of her first-class honours degree at Cambridge. I can remember almost every word of my unnecessary interruption.
“Herr Lentenov, is it necessary that we waste time on this rubbish? This poppycock? We know that these particles are almost certainly random muons! This…this…science fiction approach to our research will simply make us look fools to the outside world!”
Professor Yuri Lentenov headed the particle research unit of which I was a senior member. We might have had mutual respect but he, rightly I know now, was not amused at my words. “Grigor, I am well aware of your views on the issue and still await some supporting research from you and your team. In the meantime, please give Miss Newcombe the courtesy of hearing her full presentation.”
When I think now about what might never have happened had Megan not shown a maturity beyond her years as she proved by her own response, I shudder.
“Herr Professor, I understand your concerns and you are not the first to suggest that my work sounds like science fiction.”
“It is. Rarely have I heard such propositions within the science community. Perhaps you should write a book!” I know I was staggered by her words but not as much as by her follow up to my unreasoned and angry response.
“Herr Sokolov, I am prepared to have my theories disproved if they are wrong. Are you prepared for yours to be wrong? Would you be ready to work with me to find the correct answer?”
I was backed into a corner and forced by my colleagues to add this upstart to my team, almost as an equal.
For many months we did work together trying to understand what the mystery particles were. I say together but, though I would not then have admitted it, it was apparent that Megan was brilliant at a level most of us could only dream of. It was also quite disturbing that that brilliance was supported by an often-uncertain approach. Megan never sought to force her views on any of us but would often come out with ideas that even she suggested that I and others would feel that she was again edging into the realms of science fiction. Yet our research rapidly proved, again and again, that her version of sci-fi was definitely more sci-fact.
It must have been almost a year after that fateful day when the event occurred which, I now know, was to change the future of the human race.
“Grigor, if these figures are correct the final energy and temperatures will risk the entire accelerator. We must talk to Yuri and his team before they complete a full run.”
Megan’s words were interrupted by another member of our team. “Professor, they started a run only twenty minutes ago! Did you not know?”
“We must tell them to abort. Now! Go!”
Megan had grabbed her mobile and started calling Yuri. When he answered Megan quickly passed the message to abort and then added “Kill the containment fields below the air vents and clear those areas fast.”
Lentenov, to his eternal credit did not question why, and we could hear him yelling to his team to carry out her instructions. We also heard someone cry out. “The temperatures are off the scale.”
Moments later the building shook to the sound of metal shrieking under immense pressure. Then just as suddenly, and more disturbingly, silence fell. What had occurred that day has been well documented by others but there was a video call later that day that has never left my thoughts.
Yuri was contacted by NASA who wanted to know what had killed one of their geostationary satellites. The recordings from that satellite, before it died, from a second satellite and a recently launched lunar orbiter were stunning. The NASA operations director explained that a bright object with a temperature of forty thousand degrees had risen from an area close to Geneva travelling at over ten thousand kilometres per second as it passed the satellites’ orbit. It had slowed but still struck the lunar surface less than an hour later leaving a crater half a kilometre across.
A year before I would have laughed Megan out of the room if she had made a suggestion such as she now did, after I had had to admit that I didn’t have a clue what had happened. Looking back now, her words were frighteningly obvious but, as ever, she took her time before answering.
“I can suggest a possible solution but, and I mean but, it will need a lot of work to confirm.”
“Go on.” We all demanded in unison.
“We were considering the results of earlier aborted accelerator runs when it happened. My thoughts are that we might be close to replicating the conditions that are surmised to have existed at or immediately after the post big bang expansion period of the universe. On a small scale, of course. All our theories suggest highly energetic, and possibly short-lived, particles must have formed then but this is way beyond anything I imagined.”
Now you see why I consider Megan Newcombe to be on a par with both Einstein and Hawking.
The first question we had to address was, could we repeat the experiment and, then, if successful could we find a way to harness such energy?
A happy outcome of the difficulties we faced was that the aerospace community provided major support to assist in developing the materials needed to contain the plasma formed. In particular there was a young engineer specialising in exactly that field – Alan Piper. His input and leadership of the team that developed the earliest material capable of holding the exotic particles in a container has often been overlooked. Later improvements followed, due mostly to his tenacity.
Our combined research at CERN and, largely at Bristol, England, would eventually lead us to finding ways to utilise the energy to counter climate change and then to power the first starships. In the end the only human starships.
Alan had often wondered how the world could come together to fund our work, now as the first mammoth ships, carrying some six thousand people, left for Saturn before engaging their warp drives, the reason became clear. A huge fleet of alien ships had split and attacked the Saturn space station only hours after the larger ship, Einstein, had reached a safe distance and vanished into its own universe.
I was one of the lucky few who were on Mars as Earth despite mounting a massive defence was reduced to a smouldering wreck of a planet. More ships were heading our way and all looked lost until the third starship, Europa, signalled the settlement to evacuate and join them as they tried to escape.
Today, I sit in one of the science labs on board this wonderful ship writing my memoirs, though I wonder if they will ever be read.
It is now almost ten years since we escaped and despite having reached countless star systems with planets, none have been habitable for us. We can only keep trying, we have no home to return to now and I can only be thankful that my shameful actions did not turn that brilliant scientist away from her love of science. Had I managed that then there would be no human race. Because of her the three starships carrying an admittedly pitifully few thousand humans have escaped and can search for a new home. Should the Europa fail there is still the hope that our other ships will succeed. I pray that that will happen.
<|endoftext|>
The bombs dropped as we ran for our lives. The sky, blood red, rain pouring buckets, making the ground slippery beneath my feet. Each time another one landed, the ground shook – as we sped along the street, joining others in the mad dash into the forest surrounding our village. I turn to my brother Nate; his skin is ashen, he is shivering – pure terror on his face. We run and run until we are nearly out of breath. We run through the forest and take cover under the lip of an enormous rockface. Ahead the trees are on fire.
We were at home, everything was normal…
“Nathan, take your cap off at the table,” Dad whips it from his head. “Did you finish your project son?” he asks my twin brother.
“Dad, I already told you, I have finished, I’m just proofreading it now to make sure it is perfect,” ever the perfectionist.
“Yeah like that would ever happen, stupid,” I say belligerently, poking my tongue at him.
Mum is dishing out mashed potatoes and plonking the fluffy white delight onto our plates, with salad – she’s the best cook. She should have been a chef, not a Journalist, though admittedly she is small town famous where we live. She recently wrote a series of articles about the war overseas, there is growing fear it will turn nuclear. So far, millions of people have been displaced, ripped from their homes, had them bombed to pieces, and many have died. Mum says she doesn’t want us to read her articles, says it is too frightening to read. She says we need to just be kids and that reading stuff like that is not for the eyes of youngsters, she still thinks we are twelve-years-old! But my curious 15-year-old self knows how to buy a newspaper and where to hide them so Mum doesn’t find out. It’s hypocritical of her, really, considering my twin is writing an essay about the realities of war – he’s writing about the Holocaust.
I am munching on fried chicken and mashed potatoes, while I think about those families who can’t eat together anymore. I have a vivid imagination I am told, and always have – according to Dad. Although I can imagine the devastation, the consequences of war, I can’t fully grasp the concept of what it would feel like to no longer have a house to go home to after school. Or not having a school at all! Wishful thinking. What would it be like to walk for days and days to escape to a place of safety? What would happen to Anya my BFF? Or my crush Hayden Smith?
“…earth to Tessa, anyone home?” I clear my eyes and look at my family, why are they staring at me like that?
“What?” I ask, puzzled.
“Where did you go sweetie? Dad asked you a question,” Mum’s beautiful voice softly pulls me back to the present.
“Just day dreaming. Sorry. I was just…I was thinking about my assignment,” change of subject.
After dinner and dishes I head up to my bedroom to finish my History study on the life of Albert Einstein. He was a fascinating man indeed. His theory of relativity changed the face of the world as we know it. I look at the clock, it tells me it is already 9:30 p.m. Shit I’ve been at it for two hours and I still have a ways to go…a yawn makes my eyes water.
Suddenly, there is a rumble above the house, it sounds like thunder, but it’s not because it doesn’t stop. Then a loud explosion in the distance has me jumping from my study desk in fright – sending the chair flying backwards. I go out into the hallway to see if anyone else had heard it; Nate’s door is shut, but I can hear him playing Warcraft. I make my way to our folks bedroom; Mum is asleep with her laptop on the bed and her side light on. At the top of the stairs, I hear the TV going, so Dad must be watching the late-night news. I head down to query him, as I can still hear the noise that sounds like thunder rumbling, but now it feels like a vibration coming through the floor. I enter the living room.
“Dad, what’s that noise?” I ask, bringing him out of his doze.
He turns down the volume with the remote.
“What was that Tess? What noise?”
I probably imagined it: I console myself.
“Never mind,” I say.
I leave him there glued to the carnage on the TV, Dad shaking his head as missiles explode over a small township, people running, the place is lit up with fire…Entering the kitchen, I go for the fridge, I love milk before I go to sleep, but sometimes it gives me nightmares. As I’m gulping back my drink, the power suddenly goes out, plunging me into total darkness. What the hell? I navigate my way into the living room, and call out to Dad. He is no longer in his Lazy-Boy chair.
“Dad, where are you?”
No reply. He must have gone into the basement to check the circuit board. I look out the window, all the power is off in the neighbouring houses and the street lights are out too. That strange noise is getting louder, the vibration pulsing through me. I go to the basement door, but it is locked up tight, so Dad isn’t in there sorting out the power, where is he? I have a sudden sense of dread, not knowing where this feeling is coming from, I shake it off and head upstairs. When I make it to the top, I yell out to my family.
“Dad, Mum, Nate, where are you all?”
Fear grips me hard…it makes me run. I run into my folks bedroom, expecting them to both be in bed. My phone! It’s in my pocket, I must have grabbed it when I left my bedroom. I switch on the torch function and scan the room. No parents. I check the bed, empty. I check the en-suite, empty too. So I run straight to my brother’s room and barge in without knocking.
“What the hell Tess, you gave me a fright!”
“You hear that too don’t you?” I ask him.
“Yeah, what is it? And what the fuck happened to the power?” he asks, getting off the bed, coming towards me, that’s when we both hear it…
BANG! There is an explosion in the street, it rocks the house beneath me. We run to the window, and the street is on fire! Hard rain hits the window. The rumbling has stopped and now it’s an electronic pulse, it spreads through my body, momentarily stunning me. Through the window we see people running out of their homes and along the street, some carrying their screaming children.
“Nate, we need to get out of here,” I scream in his face – he grips my arm, he is shaking.
“Yip, let’s go. But we need to find Mum and Dad,” he runs from the room, leaving me shocked at the scene outside.
“Come on!” he screams from the hallway.
We search and yell for them, but they are nowhere. The next blast sends items falling all around us – it’s so close; my ears are ringing. I’m so scared my teeth are chattering. Where are our parents? Suddenly I am overcome with fear, so we bolt it out the front door and join the others running along the street. I spot Mr. and Mrs. Harris, I baby sit for them sometimes, I run towards them, dragging my brother by the arm.
“Mr. Harris, what is going on?” I ask as we jog beside them.
“Oh, Tessa and Nate. We are being attacked,” he says gripping little Billie in his arms.
“But why? Who?” I ask breathless.
“They are bombing us; I don’t know who!” he stops to take a breather at the very edge of the forest.
“Who is they?” I slow my breathing – I am nearly out of breath.
Another explosion, this time I look back and all of our houses are on fire. This breaks me as I tremble in fear. Our beautiful home is in flames. I can’t believe what I am seeing. It’s like a nightmare, but I am awake. Nate is pulling at my arm to flee, but I need more answers.
“Tell me, who is doing this!” he moves little Billie into his other arm.
“To be honest, they don’t know who, or which country is doing this to us. I was watching the news when the White House was blown to pieces, right there on TV. The power went out so I don’t know anything more,” his face is full of terror.
Mrs Harris is lugging their cat Coco in a cage. Running with their child and pet, this saddens me to the core.
“Have you seen our parents?”
“No love, sorry. Come on Angela, we have to get out of here. Bye kids, get somewhere safe,” and they leave us there, alone.
We run into the forest. The trees are on fire. We hide under the lip of a rockface to catch our breaths.
“Nate, we need to come up with a plan,” my throat is on fire, my eyes sting.
"Do you think they dropped chemical bombs? I’ve been reading up on chemical weapons, these could be those, they eat your brain! They call them biochemical warfare,” he’s drenched and shivering.
“I don’t want to know about bombs, we have to plan. I think we should head to the river, it’s probably our best bet,” a cold shiver passes through me.
I can’t catch my breath. I feel dizzy and lightheaded. And another bomb lights up the scene. The forest is on fire and in the flash from the bomb, there are dead bodies on the ground. I scream and scream until Nate covers my mouth.
“Shut up! Can you hear it?”
I do: it sounds like gun fire. I am puzzled, who would be shooting? Then I see them in the distance, the light from the shot blasts, I realise they are not guns but some sort of lasers. It pulverizes the environment, there are people blown to bits, blood and gore splatter the trees. Children screaming for their parents, parents screaming for their children. What the hell is going on? The chaos is beyond belief. Everything is happening so fast I can’t keep up with it all. So we run towards the river, it’s not far to go.
On our way we have to take cover again, this time in the hollow of a tree. We used to play here when we were kids, so we know this place well. There is a rustling of trees, branches snapping. We are both frozen to the spot as we see something hideous coming towards us. It isn’t human. It is all black, shimmering and seems to blend in with the environment. There are two of them, heading right for us. As they get nearer, I can see them more clearly. They are semi-metallic; I can tell this by the light from the fires reflecting off their bodies. They have huge red eyes, and four arms. They are at least seven feet tall. Their heads are large and oval. Scared that they can see us, I scrunch into a ball. Nate is trembling beside me, hugging his legs and rocking back and forth. The creatures are talking to each other, but not in a language I have ever heard; it sounds like beeping and clicking. Huddled there we listen as they walk past us, into the trees. Slowly, we come out of the tree. The rumbling has returned and it is drawing closer, getting louder.
Come on, we have to run!” I scream.
He is getting slow, his breath laboured as we skirt around the trees, jump over what is most probably dead bodies, but I don’t want to look. Finally, the river appears in front of us. Others have made it here too. They are gathered on the banks, and some are hiding in the bushes. We sit on the grass in an opening. My eyes scan the area for our parents, but I can’t really see that well, my eyes are burning. The sounds war makes is horrifying. People are crying, some are screaming. They are calling out for their loved ones.
More explosions in the distance, scares me, they seem to be getting closer. What will happen if they find us all here? Where are our parents? Why did they leave us to fend for ourselves? It doesn’t make any sense, none of this does! They wouldn’t have just left us, they wouldn’t! Suddenly I feel overcome with grief, we are alone now, just the two of us. We are too young to live without our parents. I should have been nicer to my brother, but all we do is fight. It pisses our parents off, causes fights between Mum and Dad. I know I have been ungrateful, not fully appreciating the things our parents have done for us over the years. I should have listened when they gave me advise, all they were trying to do was protect us from the big bad world.
I thought I knew everything, didn’t need their advice or their snooping into my life. Grumbling through dinner because I hate peas, or yelling at my Mum because she cleaned my bedroom! Now it’s too late and I can’t have that time back. I should have said yes, when Dad asked if I needed help with Math's. I said no, because I didn’t want to spend time with him. It was so different when we were little. I was a Daddies girl; I loved my Dad. Riding on his shoulders, him swinging me around, me giggling in pure delight. Mum brushing my hair, telling me how beautiful and clever I am. All of the memories finally turn into giant sobs that practically engulf me, trying to pull me under. I hug my brother and together we cry into each other, like we used to do when we were kids and one of us got told off. Now I will never get the chance to tell them I love them. It’s been years since I uttered those words. If they were here I would make it up to them, love them more, appreciate the life I had.
“Tessa, what are we going to do? Where are we going to live?” Nate asks, in between sobs.
“I don’t know. I guess we have to wait until morning. Are you tired?”
“Yes, shattered. I am sad too. I want our parents,” he cries even harder.
I think about the hideous creatures we saw in the forest. Are they Aliens come to destroy the human race? Does it have anything to do with the war overseas? I am trying to rationalise this, when all of a sudden we turn towards a loud sound coming from the border between the river and the forest. Something huge is crashing through the trees, it is flattening them in its wake. What the hell?
“Nate, we need to leave this place, it is too open. Should we get into the cave?”
He looks lost and abandoned. He is about to answer, when suddenly beams of light appear above us. People are screaming as they are being lifted off the ground and taken into something I cannot see. Is it camouflaged? Their screams prompt me into action. We get up and run as red lasers crisscross the area, destroying people where they stand.
“Get to the cave Tess, it’s our only hope.”
We run for our lives as the horrendous sounds of screams and wails permeate the air. When we make it to the cave, we hide behind a rock. We wait for what feels like forever, hoping for the breaking dawn to come. Then there is a noise at the entrance to the cave. It could be people taking cover, we aren’t the only ones who know about this place. It’s a small cave, so we can see the entrance clearly. I sneak a look, and in utter bewilderment, I watch as in slow motion, the creatures come towards us with their lasers aimed into the cave. We are going to die here. We have lost everything; our parents, our home, and now probably our lives. They see us, come in our direction, and I scream and scream and scream…
I wake up. I am in my bedroom sitting at my desk. I am confused. Dad is talking to me; I must be dead.
“Honey, go to bed, it’s past midnight,” his voice seems to come from a faraway land.
“Tessa, seriously, get to bed.”
It’s my Dad, he is real and I am so shocked, I run to him and throw my arms around him and hold on as tight as I can.
“Whoa, what’s got into you?” he asks, hugging me back so tight I could die here and be happy.
“Dad, I had the worst nightmare ever,” I tell him as he tucks me into bed and kisses my forehead.
“Get some sleep, tell me about it in the morning, okay?”
“Okay Dad,” I say as he walks towards the door. “Dad, I love you!” he turns to me.
“Sweetheart, I love you too! To the moon and back.”
I’m too shattered to think about the nightmare. I drift off with love pulsing through me, and a new found appreciation for everything I have in my life. Sleep comes and all is well in my world. I am safe in my bed; it was just a nightmare that is someone else’s reality.
THE END
<|endoftext|>
Once upon a time, there was a star named A—”
“A?” Erin shook her head. “See, this is why you don't tell stories. That’s a literal letter. Out of every name in the world, you choose A.”
Leslie shrugged. “Lots of stars are named with things we wouldn’t name people. Also, you never know—maybe there really is a star named A. Or another singular letter.”
“But it’s a story I want to understand. Just say Hannah or something. Not like it’s homework or something.”
“There was a star named A that one day, fell out of the sky—”
“But why? I’m sure stars don’t fall out of the sky for no reason.” Erin gestured wildly with her hands. “Was there an accident? Was the star dying or something? An ancient evil? Gimme sustenance!”
“Just listen!” Leslie sighed and rubbed the bridge of her nose. “Yes, there actually was an evil force that’s behind the falling of the star. It fell to earth and was confined to a human body. It lost its sibling in the crossfire, as well as other loved ones. It’s hard to explain, since a lot of things stars do can’t be confined to human concepts.”
“It’s fiction. Make it up. Also, ‘human concepts’? I should have figured your story would have been based on current events.”
“This has nothing to do with the meteorite. For one, it’s not a star that fell, but rock. Most of it is scattered across the atmosphere anyway. Probably burned up and gone.” Which was technically true. Stars are big balls of gas and minerals. Nothing more, nothing less. Least of all should her fictional story that she completely made up somehow reign true. “Now, onto the actual story.”
“Okay, okay.” Erin stretched out on her place in the grass. “You can start.”
“It all started when A went to Sun for a visit to relay a message, since B—that ‘sibling’ I was referring to—couldn’t make it. Sun wasn’t shining as bright as it usually did, but A never thought to be concerned over it . . . “
Sun dulled its shine as A approached it. Could it be that Sun realized that A wasn’t exactly B, but a different star? A wasn’t exactly twinkling, but it knew it was a rather bright star, so that could be the reason. B usually made these kinds of trips because it could afford the time to travel the extra light-years, but recently B has been busy, bending those very lightyears to run errands. With that, A went instead. It knew how much B visited Sun, and didn’t want B to run itself dimmer trying to do everything. Everything must be perfect, even when it already seems so.
A drew closer and began to glow. It started slowly, matching B for a bit before brightening up. A began to twinkle—bright, brighter, then nearly at its brightest—then dulled down. It had to show that it wasn’t B someway.
In turn, Sun dulled its light. It went down, cool and cooler and then even cooler—almost to the point in which it looked cooler than it ever had in the past, but A didn’t know Sun nearly as well to make such assumptions—and then it brightened again. Acceptance.
Sun was a rather lonely star—working to keep its little planets on track. Not out of companionship, like with A and B. No, instead a guiding light—something other than what A is for Earth—leading planets with an everlasting shine, even with the furthest, littlest planet. Sun shone again, and A twinkled in response.
And if, for some reason, Sun didn’t reach A’s expectations of shine based on B’s information—how the light of Sun was supposed to be different from the light of other stars—then A never thought to prioritize it. 
Which inevitably was the beginning of A’s downfall.
Literally.
(“So then A went back to B to tell—well, shine since talking didn’t exist among stars—that all was well with Sun. Again, it never thought too much about the dimming, since everything in the Universe is planned to a startling degree, including when they’re supposed to dim . . . “)
A twinkled in the dark emptiness, drawing the attention of B. It just returned from its long errands of planning—where new stars should go and dying ones should be positioned. Where black holes and neutron stars should go, and for how long. Things that won’t come into play until after B moves on and Sun swallows some of its planets in its pursuit of growth, glowing red. However, a red Sun wasn’t for light years ahead, so no need for further planning regarding its system.
So A twinkled again, and this time it stitched together the communication between A and Sun, about Mercury and Venus and Earth and Mars. There was also Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and Neptune—and oh, don’t forget about Pluto, either. About drifting rocks and floating planets, everything delicately spinning around Sun. All was well, and nothing was drifting away from how things were planned.
A and B . . . they trusted one another, and have been since they were formed. A and B had a different kind of companionship than B and Sun, and even a different form of companionship than the ones between them and the other stars of Alpha. They often—which, for other beings that weren’t stars, isn’t often at all—relayed messages to one another as well as simply basked in their lights. 
B wasn’t as bright as A, and because of that A was away more than B, often working while B worked on planning. Regardless, they stuck together and trusted one another in a pure-hearted way, to put it simply.
A didn’t include the odd absence of warmth (in the odd, organic definition), nor did it find the need to. 
Especially since it wasn’t very important.
(“ . . . so know about that ancient evil? It comes into play now . . . “)
Orion was the first constellation to notice the tear in the fabric of the Universe. Well, the first within a reasonable distance.
A’s constellation—Alpha Canis Major—was notified not much later, when Adhara happened to be notified first from Betelgeuse. From there, the information spread quickly—A could only really compare it to a supernova with the quickness. Soon the entire Milky Way was on edge, from stars to the planets. A wouldn’t be surprised if the terrestrial lifeforms somehow figured it out. 
The tear was located near Sagittarius A—not the constellation, but the black hole—in the center of the Milky Way. The thing was, the tear itself wasn’t affected by the supermassive black hole. In fact, it seemed as if the Sagittarius A was the one affected by that tear, which was unheard of. Stars shine and communicate within the Universe, dark energy grows and expands the Universe, and black holes suck things out of the Universe, including light itself. It had always been like that, from the very beginning. 
Now, if sources were correct, then Sagittarius A seemed to be the one to slowly be disappearing as the tear continued to grow. The Milky Way was vibrating with activity, trying to make sure everything stayed in order while getting rid of the tear. Trying to desperately keep things in order.
Eventually—begrudgingly—they had to reach out to Andromeda for aid.
(“Like, you know, a call for help—something like that. And as for the rips—imagine you have a tear in your backpack—”
“So things are falling out of the universe?” Erin asked.
“No . . . think of it as things falling through the universe and into something even more unknown. Something that keeps growing.”
“Sounds weird.”
“I’m a weird person.”)
Another tear appeared, this time near the edge of the Milky Way. There were fewer stars and planets to damage, but there was dark matter, which was another travesty. Stars either traveled more often to bring news or not at all to preserve their constellations or placement. Sun seemed especially worried, B trying its best to reassure the elder that things were getting fixed. Not even the oldest of stars have seen something like this, and it was starting to wear down on the Milky Way itself. 
Regardless, A and B had to travel more often (which, A quickly found out, was possible even with their already busy workload) due to the changes because they were Sirius, and they provided more stability with their form of communication than the rest of Alpha. After all, A and B were two halves of an exceptional star. 
All the while, A realized that whenever a star was sent to Andromeda for guidance, it didn't seem to return. 
(“They aren’t returning because they’re . . . falling through the universe?”
“Right! Like they’re going to a new place.”
“So like different dimensions?”
“Hmm . . . I guess the multiverse works. Except a much more twisted, dangerous version of our universe is out there somewhere, trying to take over ours. Like a virus.”
“Oh.”)
At one point, stars started to dim.
Dimming was a natural part of a star’s cycle—something that’s expected of them. Natural for every star. At one point the cores no longer were what they once were and they started to dim. Dimming didn’t signal the end of their lives as much as it signaled the beginning of what came after, from becoming a black hole to a white dwarf to a supernova. It all gets planned and positioned, from the time to the place, but it happens all the same.
None of the dimmings was planned.
Especially not Sun’s.
It started abruptly—almost slower than usual as if something was savoring the way things were coming undone—and was noticed even later. Between communicating, changing plans, and trying to be the best stars and constellations they can be, Alpha was as busy as Orion, who was also as busy as Ara and Cassiopeia and everything in between. Even the stray stars that belonged to no particular constellation couldn’t just do nothing. 
Sirius may be younger than Sun, but the latter wasn’t nearly far enough in development to even start dimming too much. Even when it starts to glow red, it will grow bigger and slightly cooler, but that wasn’t even close to the present. Now, Sun needed to remain a smaller, yellow star. It was for the best.
And then it started to dim and flicker. Not a lot—not even enough for the lifeforms on Earth to notice—but enough for the surrounding planets to notice and immediately spread the news. Stars were dimming left and right, losing their shine—their twinkle—that let them communicate. What were stars if they couldn’t communicate to the rest of the Universe?
B was the first one to reach Sun and it was all the same: its shine suddenly decreasing, its energy fluctuating, and its presence suddenly less than what it should be. As if an outside force was invading them, taking for what they have bit by bit. 
It was different, this time around. The dimming. It was so close this time, not in the middle of the Milky Way or at the edge of it. It wasn’t near another constellation Alpha barely interacted with, either. It was with Sun, the star that carried its planets and couldn’t go because if it did, then what would happen to its planets? Every one of them will change rapidly, and Earth’s life forms will surely start to die out at an astonishing rate. Pluto will no longer have the support it needed and do who knows what.
And—and—and—
And it all circled back to those mysterious tears.
A and B no longer were much further from one another than a couple of light years after that.
(“Sirius?”
“Both A and B. Sirius is a binary star system with two stars, which is also why I say that A and B are siblings. A is far brighter than the other, and therefore plays a slightly bigger role in the Universe, but they’re close to one another regardless. Well, A was bright until . . . “)
A was starting to dim. 
No, it was doing more than dimming. It was fading. Losing the right to stay in the Universe. It was watching as it all unraveled, from lightyears to black holes to quasars to the lack of communication to the decreasing number of stars to the increasing number of tears. Tears increased by the dozens, some millions of lightyears apart while others were less than one light year apart. They varied in shape, size, and length. 
Planets were starting to disintegrate, simply dissolving into nearly nothing and then going through the tear to never be seen again. Stars were disappearing without so much as a soft light remaining. Dark matter was slowing down, no longer speeding up. Black holes were shrinking until they too disappeared. What was once orderly turned chaotic quickly. 
And then—
There was another tear. Right in the middle of Alpha. 
Right where A was—
And then A was fading faster than ever before. And then the Universe looked to be collapsing in on itself. And then Adhara and Wezen drifted away, trying to save what’s left of the constellation. It was what the Milky Way came to: trying to preserve what was left and trying to rebuild it all constantly. Trying to salvage what could be saved. Trying instead of succeeding.
And while A was a bright star, one that twinkled and shone better than many, it wasn’t enough to combat a tear, something communicated so much yet is known so little about. 
And then B was there.
And it pushed A away. Away away away it went, shooting somewhere new, somewhere away from Alpha, away from the tear, away from B.
And B, dear B, the other half to A, they have been together through formation and development and expansion and shrinking and wanted to continue to do so until they become supernovas or black holes or neutron stars because they were two halves of what made Sirius. B couldn’t do much without A. A couldn't do much without B.
And then B was gone. Gone and—
And then A’s surroundings twisted. It could perceive more dimming stars. More collapsing planets. More tears that threaten the Universe. 
Its home, its life, its work. Its everything.
And then A knew no more.
(“So then it crashed on Earth?”)
A does not know how to talk. A was a star, who twinkled and shone and was a beacon. Sirius was an even bigger beacon. Sun is an even bigger beacon than Sirius. 
But now, A crouches on Earth, flesh scraping the ground—flesh, A has a body now. Something organic and vulnerable. Possible explanations flee A’s mind—and tears beading down cheeks. The Universe kissed her skin as she fell as if giving her a final goodbye—her skin being as dark as night and hair as bright as her light. Despite this, she’s now so dull without her light and is so loud instead. Confined to a body—to a cage in which the first thing she does upon realization is wail in anguish. 
She’s alone, she's alone, away from all that she’s known, her fellow stars dimming and who knows what else. She no longer shines, a trembling, cold pit where she used to glow. She’s carved out—empty and devoid of everything that made her existence worth indulging. Given flesh and blood—reduced to a point of insignificance on a planet that’s ever-changing and is slowly dying. (She wails louder and louder and louder—) She can now touch and taste and hear and feel—feel Earth underneath her fingertips and remember the tear less than five lightyears away from her current destination and can’t help but to tremble.
She screams louder, her hands and feet in the dirt, and ignores the sounds (so loud—has Earth always been this loud?) around her. 
She fell to Earth and has no idea how to prevent the Universe itself from collapsing from the tears infecting it. 
“ . . . and that’s it.”
“What?!” Erin shouts, “That’s not a good ending! What about the tears? Is this supposed to lead up to that meteorite? What happened to B after that—”
“Uh—well—” Leslie stumbles over her words, trying in vain to come up with an explanation for lack of content. “Well, it’s just the story of how A fell from her home. Again, the meteorite may have inspired this story—”
“I knew it!” she shouts.
“—but still, it’s purely fictional. I mean, I can come up with more for it—” She could, but she doesn’t have anything now. “—but I think her beginning is just as important as her end. She’s the hero and all, but she’s also sad that she’s alone. That at least deserves some form of acknowledgment, right?”

The helicopter’s blades thup-thup-thupped steadily as the small yellow machine flew low over the forest. The morning sun gave a coniferous green glow to the trees that spread in all directions like a bristly shag rug. Beside the pilot sat a young geologist in new blue overalls and fresh leather boots; nodding and staring intently at the screen of a laptop. His screen displayed data from the GPR transceiver that was mounted underneath the helicopter, and to him things looked promising. The pilot had no idea what it all meant, and he didn’t need to; he just needed to fly the grid-pattern that was laid out on his navigation screen. The mining company contracts paid well, and the pilot hoped to be easy to work with, so he could win more of them. He spoke into his headset.
“Our grid is going to take us right past an old ghost town. It’s just over this next ridge here. You want to take a look?” he said.
Harris, the geologist, looked up from his laptop and adjusted the mic by his lips. He was new and enthusiastic.
“Ghost town? Ya, for sure, let’s take a look.” Harris liked this pilot, he was mostly business, but partly fun.
The pilot pulled the stick a little to the left as they passed over the ridge, and Harris saw a well-manicured town appear below, through the clear bubble window of the helicopter. 
“This is Kitsault. It was built all at once in the seventies, by a big mining company.”
“It’s crazy that they used to build these insta-towns.” Harris said. He looked down at the empty streets, lined with identical houses but devoid of life. There were no cars, no laundry drying in the sun, no people anywhere. It was an eerie sight. 
‘The whole town is empty?” Harris asked.
“Yup, they built it all state-of-the-art. Then the market crashed for the metal they were into, and they just moved everyone out.”
“Do you know what they were mining?”
“Aw man, you got me there. It was some metal with a weird name.”
“Ah, ok. The town looks so clean though, who’s mowing the grass?”
“Well, some rich guy bought the town for whatever reason, and now he keeps everyone out. There’s just a couple of caretakers now I think. They even have electricity here still.”
“Wait, he keeps everyone out? How?”
“It’s private property, there’s a big locked gate a long way down the road.” 
The pilot eased right, starting a loop around the town. Harris looked down on this strange town that wasn’t a town. The caretakers obviously did a good job. He could see neat stacks of firewood and gardens that were obviously tended, almost like everyone was going to come back any day and resume life as usual. It seemed like a lot of upkeep for a ghost town. Then the pilot said something about the hospital and school below, but Harris wasn’t listening, he was looking at rocks. In a field below, someone had laid out rocks and wood to spell out that universal call for help, in letters twenty feet across.
S O S.
“Uh, we have an SOS in the grass over here.” Harris said.
“What? Where?”
“We just passed it, right off this side.” Harris turned back in his seat, looking to where they had just come from. “Just in the field with the goalposts; looks like a school.”
The pilot slowed and brought the helicopter around. He could see it now too.
“Well I’ll be darned. There’s something I never thought I’d see.”
Harris pulled out his phone and took a picture of the SOS in the grass. There was no cell reception.
“Do you think we should land and check it out?”
“I don’t know…it’s pretty well-known that no one is allowed to visit this place.” the pilot said. 
“Ya but, I mean…it’s an SOS. Where do you think the caretakers are?”
“Tell you what, I’m going to just drop down a bit and hover over the field here. We’ll see if anyone comes out.”
The pilot worked his craft and brought the helicopter to a hover about 100 feet above the ground. Both men scanned the empty town and field below them, looking for a caretaker to come running out from a building with arms waving, but nothing happened. The pilot was thinking.
“Alright, let’s put her down here by the SOS. No one is going to fault us for stopping to help.”
It seemed to both of them like the right thing to do.
Nobody came speeding up on a quad. No one came out to greet them or admonish them for trespassing on this forbidden land. Once the engine wound down and the blades stopped spinning, everything was still. Chirping birds returned to the forest at the edge of the field. A woodpecker played its staccato rhythm on a tree. Harris and the pilot got out and stood pondering the SOS on the mowed-not-so-long-ago grass, as if somehow the nature of its emergency would be revealed by their contemplation. The field was dotted profusely with large puff-ball type mushrooms, and was bordered by thick forest to the east and southeast. The edges of the field were lined with rocks of various sizes, presumably piled up there when the field was leveled.
“This took awhile, to lay all this out.” said Harris, looking at the SOS.
“Seems like a lot of work to go to.” said the pilot. “I wonder why they didn’t just use a radio?”
The pilot looked at the two buildings nearby. There was a large antenna protruding from the roof of school. Harris followed the pilot’s gaze.
“Let’s go see if the school is open, maybe we can find out what’s going on.”
“Alright, sounds like a plan.” said Harris.
“Maybe those caretakers are around here somewhere.”
The two men started walking across the grass the short distance to the school. 
“What’s with all these mushrooms? They’re crazy!” Harris said.
“We’re in the wilderness man, shit gets big out here! Just don’t step on them. They probably stink to high heaven or something; it’s the last thing we need on the trip home.”
Harris took the pilot’s advice and walked carefully. The men rounded the northeast corner of the school and found the main entrance. A sign above the door read “Kitsault School - A Place For Young Minds To Grow”. The front door of the school opened just like it would’ve on a regular schoolday morning. A skylight let light into the foyer, illuminating bare bulletin boards and an empty office with a tidy, unused desk. On the desk was a rolodex, a vintage computer, and a rotary phone, dustless and frozen in time.
“This is so weird” said Harris, “I feel like I’m entering a time capsule.”
Harris looked down the hallway to the right of the office. The hallway had skylights too, but Harris could see electric light coming from a room a little way down the hall. He looked to the pilot.
“There’s a light on down here.” he said, and then he called down the hall.
“HELLO?” 
The air was close and still. Harris paused, listening, but there was nothing.
“We’re coming down the hall. We saw the SOS in the grass!” 
His voice held a mixture of nervousness and hope; nervousness because he felt he was about to uncover the big mystery, and hope that they might be able to help someone.
The room the light was coming from was a lab. It had once been the science classroom, so it had all of the accoutrements required to make it a good lab. Instead of desks there were long workstations. There were plugs, wires, and lines coming from the ceiling. The workstations were covered in modern implements of science, and did not belong in the time capsule. A large centrifuge sat at the near end of the row. There was a modern computer, and a “Thermo Scientific Fridge” full of all kinds of plastic trays and sample containers. There was a grey apparatus that looked like a rice cooker, except that it obviously wasn’t, because on it read “BIO-RAD MyCycler”. Harris and the pilot surveyed it all with silent awe. This was not what they had expected to find. They had expected a body or two, perhaps some mangled bloody groundskeepers, but there was no one here. Harris walked into the room and looked around. On the wall opposite to the door, staring him in the face, was a framed quote.  
He who is unable to live in society,
or has no need to…
…must be either a beast, or a god.
-Aristotle
Beside the framed wisdom was a row of coat-hooks, with one white labcoat. An embroidered name was obscured by a fold in the fabric, and Harris reached out to see just who had been working here.
B. Einstein
“You’ve got to be kidding me.” Harris said under his breath, more to himself than to the pilot on the other side of the room.
“What’s that man?” called the pilot.
“The guy who works here is named Einstein. Can you believe it?” Harris said, walking over to where the pilot stood. He was examining the radio that was mounted to the wall.
“I figured out why they didn’t use the radio.” he said. He held up a spiral cord with nothing at the end but some cut wires. “Mic’s missing.”
“Well, there goes my hope of ordering pizza” Harris joked.
“What do you think they were up to out here?” the pilot asked.
“I honestly have no idea.”
“What do you mean, what kind of a scientist are you?” the pilot joked back.
“I’m a geologist. I study rocks. This lab was set up for…I don’t know what.”
“Oh come on rock-doc, you can figure it out!” The pilot chuckled.
Harris walked over to one end of a workstation and looked at some books that were stacked there. Genome Editing, Rewriting Our DNA, Uncommon Theories on Common Elements, Plants and Mushrooms of North America. There were many more, but Harris got the point.
“Correction, I do know what” he said. “They were up to something they shouldn’t have been.”
“What do you mean?”
“These books are on gene editing and DNA alteration, and we’re a long way from any regulators or prying eyes. Why else would they be out here?
The pilot shifted his weight from one foot to the other, suddenly nervous.
“So you’re telling me this is some crazy movie scene right here? Like where the mad scientist makes a crazy monster in a remote lab, and then everything goes terribly wrong? 
“Well, I don’t know for sure. Maybe” Harris said. 
“People shouldn’t go messing with that kind of thing.”
Harris couldn’t quite tell if the pilot was joking now, or if he was genuinely worried. It certainly did seem to be like something he described though, at least the mad-scientist-in-the-woods part.
“Tell you what, let’s get out of here. There’s no one here anyways.”
“I’ll second that motion” said the pilot. Between the ghost town SOS, the cut radio cord, and the abandoned DNA lab, he was at his daily limit for weird adventure. He would feel better when they were back outside.
The two men headed back the way they came. The fresh air and warm sunlight felt good after the stale air and empty, crypt-like silence of the school. Harris and the pilot started heading back to the helicopter, but as they were passing the other small building across from the main entrance, Harris was struck by one last morsel of curiosity.
“I’m just going to go poke my head in here, to make sure” said Harris, motioning to the other building with a nod of his head.
“Alright, but I’m going back the bird. We should get going anyways, schedule and all that. If no one has shown up by now, there’s no one here. It’s not like they didn’t hear us land.” 
“Alright, I’ll just check it, you never know.”
It seemed to Harris that the second building used to be an office. There was no sign bearing cheerful platitudes from better days, but there was exposed timber-framing and river-stones adorning the entrance. It was like managers from the mine had worked here and wanted the building to look like a ski chalet. The front door here was unlocked as well, and Harris walked in tentatively.
“Hello?” he called out again, though he was less expectant of finding anyone this time. Again, there was no answer. What Harris was immediately struck by was a collection of molybdenum samples on a plinth in the middle of the room. Unmistakable with its almost reflective silver surface and jagged appearance, Harris had no doubt what he was looking at. He was a geologist after all. He was aware that molybdenum was present in the strata in this area, and now he knew what the mining company had been after here back in the seventies. These days, “Mo” was used in many things. Why hasn’t this mine been reopened? he wondered.
Harris walked to the closed door on the other side of the room, calling out another ‘hello?’ on the way just to be sure. When he opened the door, he found himself looking at a makeshift living area. There was a small kitchen that had obviously been in use, a little sitting area, and through another open door he could see what looked like an office converted into a bedroom. Hungry for explanations, Harris walked into the bedroom. There was a foul musk in the air, a man’s stale sweat mixed with something like wet dog. Rumpled clothing sat in dirty heaps around the room. The bed was unmade. Beside the bed was a small table with another beautiful, almost luminous sample of molybdenum on top of a small book. Harris picked up the glorious rock and felt the solid weight of it in his hand. The molybdenum chunk had been covering the writing on the cover of the book, which read Project Log. He put the rock in his pocket, picked up the log book, and turned to the bookmarked entry. There wasn’t time for detailed reading, but as he scanned the log, several phrases caught his eye. The spores have triggered Mo absorption…changes noticeable…unforeseen effects…abnormal muscle/hair growth…painful…last entry I think.
Suddenly the air outside was filled with a wild and angry howl, like a demon had just clawed its way out of a hole to hell. The raw, inhuman volume of the scream penetrated through the walls of the bedroom, and all of Harris’s instincts yelled RUN. He didn’t run, but clutching the log book in his hand, he left the bedroom and made his way through the living are and then out the door. He heard the helicopter turbines start to whine as he went down the steps and fear inexplicably materialized in his stomach like the arrival of an uninvited guest. He looked to the chopper as he rounded the corner of the building, and didn’t see the rocky cannonball that hurtled through the air and viciously struck the building beside his head. His eyes were wide with panic now as he looked at the splintered wood and then back to the pilot, who was motioning him frantically, his lips mouthing the word “RUN!” 
He Ran. 
He ran across the field towards the machine as the blades began to whirl. The mushrooms he had so carefully avoided exploded now in puffs of green as his boots crushed them on the frantic dash. He didn’t look back, he only looked towards escape. He ducked his head, opened the door, and jumped into the seat, and the pilot opened the throttle and pulled up on the collective. 
“We are getting the hell out of here!” the pilot said with firm, fear-fueled certainty.
“What was that?” Harris asked.
“It was THAT!”
As the helicopter began to lift off the ground, Harris saw a creature emerge from the edge of the woods. Taller than a man, a giant man-but-not-a-man. It was covered in hair, except on its hands and part of its face. Its features were huge, big eyes, huge beard, ferocious muscles rippling as it took a massive stride towards the pile of rocks and picked one up. The rock in its hand was the size of a ten-pin bowling ball, but the creature held it like it was an orange. The helicopter was twenty feet off the ground now, and the beast threw the rock like a missile, in a searing straight line towards the bulbous lower window. It hit with a crack that Harris and the pilot felt shudder through the aircraft, but the polycarbonate held. The giant creature let out another feral scream, unmistakable rage on its almost human face. The helicopter engines were strained to their capacity as the pilot asked for everything the machine could give, and then they turned, and were away.
The two men were silent, in shock at what they had just seen. Sunlight shone sideways through the aircraft cabin, as it did on any day. Sweat beaded on Harris’s brow. He held the log book in his hand. His right knee bounced with agitation and adrenaline. The sunlight highlighted the heel of his boot, tap-tap-tapping on the floor, almost in time with the blades above. With each tap of his boot the greenish spores that dusted the leather fell off into the air; illuminated floating motes. The helicopter chopped the air, back towards civilization.

My Sweet Brother
Tomorrow is Sunday. Tomorrow I am scheduled to die. 
But, not today. Today is Saturday. Today, I will race. Today, I will be free for the first time in nearly twenty-three years. I am about to run in the biggest marathon in the country and I owe it all to my big brother, Albert. 
I love running. Since I was old enough to walk, all I did was run. I ran all over the house, from room to room. I ran to and from my school. Three blocks! I ran on the playground, the sidewalks, the old dirt road behind our church, and in the woods behind our house. If there were enough room to run, I would run. 
One morning when I was ten, I was running to school and was struck by a drunk driver. I remember instantly losing the feeling of my legs and then everything else. I remember them loading me onto the helicopter as Life-Flight took me to the big hospital in the big city. My brother was there with me the whole time, holding my hand, assuring me everything would be okay.
But everything was not okay. From that day until early this morning I had been on life support. I had no chance at living a life off a machine until my sweet brother changed all that. 
I hear the announcer say, “runners get ready.” My heart is pounding as I set my feet. The gun fires. I take off. It feels great to be running again, like a dream. As my feet glide across the pavement, I can’t help but think of all the sacrifices Albert has made for me. He gave up his social life to visit me everyday in the hospital. He gave up his dream to be an engineer to become a scientist in hopes of saving me. He has devoted his life to caring for me. I don’t think a brother could love a sister any stronger than he loves me.  
Although, Albert hasn’t always been this way. Before the accident, he was awful. He did the normal older-brother things like calling me names, taking my toys until I cried, but he did worse things too. He changed my shampoo and conditioner for glue. Shaved my eyebrows in my sleep. Posted my diary on facebook. I loathed him. That is, until my accident.
After that, he changed and so did my feelings toward him. Now he is a well-respected scientist and has developed a machine that has me here running this race. I could not be happier.
As I approach mile marker six, I think about how every day when Albert would visit he would tell me,“I haven’t found a cure yet, but hang in there, what’s one more day.”
“What’s one more day?” he would say. He had a point. It wasn’t like I was going anywhere. That is, until the insurance company could no longer cover my life support. 
Last month the hospital gave me a thirty day notice, like I was a tenant getting evicted from a rental property. Albert was furious. He vowed to fix it that day. That was the last day I saw him until yesterday morning. 
As he walked in my room I was terrified that he was going to say, “I haven’t found a cure yet, but hang in there, what’s one more day.”
“What’s one more day?” had taken on a whole new meaning. This time I only had one more day.
But that was not at all what he said. Instead, he said gleaming, “I did it, Anna, I found a way to give you your life back. At least for a day.” 
I couldn’t move or respond, but I could listen. I looked into his eyes and my vision blurred as it filled with tears. I didn’t know what he had done and why it was only for a day, but I didn’t care. 
“It’s going to be okay,” Albert said, wiping a tear from my cheek. “I have signed up for the marathon run for tomorrow.”
At first, I thought this was a cruel joke, that he had reverted back to his days of being mean. Why would he be bragging about running a marathon the day before I was scheduled to die? I felt red hot. My tears continued to fall, but no longer were they tears of happiness. I became more angry as he continued to brag.
“I’ve been training for the past three years” he gripped my hand with his as he continued, “I have the endurance and speed to finish first in my age group.”
Albert was sixteen years older than me. Even though I wanted to throat punch him, I was still impressed. Then with his next breath, he washed away my anger and filled my heart with great joy. 
“I built a machine that can swap our souls, placing me in your body and you in mine“, he leaned in and kissed my forehead. “I have been training for you, so you could run the race, perhaps even win it.”
I couldn’t believe my ears. Was he being serious? 
He pulled a small gray contraption out of his briefcase. “In the morning you will wake up in my body and I will be in yours,” he said as he reached over and plugged the tiny machine into my heart monitor.  
A blue fluid flushed through the tubes in my veins and I quickly fell asleep. Next thing I knew I was in my brother’s body. I could move again, I could sit up on my own, I could turn my head, I could talk, and most importantly, I could run. 
My brother had gotten in great shape. Such great shape I felt like I could run forever. 
“Thank you, Albert, this is the best gift ever.” I said, kissing my own forehead. “I’ll see you tonight.”
What a great day, I thought, crossing the finish line. I won first place in my brother’s age group and I felt like I could run even longer. As they placed the medal around my neck, all I could think was I can’t wait to show Albert. He did it. He made this day possible. 
I grabbed a bottle of water and his jacket and headed back toward the hospital. For the first time ever, I didn’t want to run. I wanted to take my time. I wanted to soak in every last second of this day. I was sad that this day would soon be over, but I couldn’t think of a better way to spend my last day on earth. I truly had the best brother a sister could have. 
The wind became violent as I made my way up the street. I put on Albert’s coat and thrusted my hands into the pockets. My right hand rubbed against something inside the pocket. I pulled it out to see an envelope with my name written on the front. It was written in my brother’s handwriting, but he didn’t mention it last night. Maybe it was something he was going to read me after we swapped back. At first, I was going to wait, but then I decided to go ahead and read it for him. 
Dear Anna,
I hope today was the best day. I hope it was everything you had ever dreamed. I owe this day to you. After all, I’m the reason you're in the condition you are in. I never told anyone this before, but I was the drunk driver. Now that you have had your day, maybe I can go on living without the guilt I have carried for so long. 
Goodbye, Albert.
I can’t believe what I just read. I’m frozen. My hand on the hospital room door. A lump growing in my throat. A tear trickles down my cheek. Quickly, I regain my composure. Albert is sorry. He spent his life working as a scientist to give me this moment. One last day. He earned my forgiveness. I pause before turning the knob. I’m frozen for what seems like an eternity. I turn from the door and stare down the large open hallway. A smile takes over my face. I run toward the exit. What’s one more day, I thought.

Her invention must be dud because she’s been so secretive about it. What was it supposed to do? I expected more angst or bloviating, something. Her obsession was wasn’t with me, not any more. It was obvious to me now that she was hanging around for the money, to indulge her crazy ideas.
I suggested a sail to get her out of her cave, to spend time together, and she agreed, reluctantly.
“Can you trim that jib a bit?” she said. We sailed out into Nantucket Sound on a day we should have stayed at the dock. There was a small craft wind advisory, and the salt spray pounded our faces with every wave. She muscled the helm in her silent struggle against an indifferent ocean. It seemed like her internal metaphor. We argued about turning back. With lips pursed she said, “You’re such a wuss.” After that, silence and grimaced expressions. When she had had enough windward thrashing, she spun the twenty-four-foot sloop around without warning to run before the wind, transforming the boom into a giant baseball bat looking for a head to crack, and we rolled our way back, see-sawing and careening on every swell.
“I want to show you something in the lab,” she said when we returned to the house. She had never asked my help before, so I was pleasantly surprised, and curious. I followed her to the lab which doubled as the game room. She put a bizarre-looking device on my left arm, then hit a key on her computer. The device was heavy, with a ring of magnets and a small display. 
“I need you to wear this while we play,” she said.
“OK. What is it? What are all these things on it?”
“You wouldn’t understand.”
She enjoyed being superior. I would never come close to matching her intellect, but she didn’t have to rub it in all the time. Then she whipped my ass in ping pong.
“Jeeze, can’t you give me the slightest challenge? 21-12 is pathetic.”
“Sorry I’m not a wunderkind like you. Do you even like me anymore?”
“Don’t be such a whiner. Of course, I like you.”
That night she attacked me in bed, a frequent event, and it reminded me why I endured her verbal abuse.
“No, no. Don’t take it off. Keep it on your arm for the night. The experiment is still running.”     
“OK,” I said, like a good lab rat. Then, I drifted off to sleep.
The next morning, I woke up feeling disoriented and couldn’t remember where I was. We sat on the porch and had coffee, looking out at the seagrass and the empty beach.
“How did you sleep,” she asked.
“Good, but I still feel really tired. I had an incredibly vivid dream. I was floating in this space with nothing but shades of white and gray in every direction. Then I heard your voice and some other guy’s voice. Both of you were giggling. Then, you went at it a few feet away from me. You never screamed like that with me! God, it was too real! I couldn’t see anything, but the sounds were clear. I heard you leave, then nothing except the wind.
“Really. That’s interesting. Are you feeling jealous right now?”
“Well, actually yes.  Jealous—yes—jealous and angry. But I know it was just a dream.”
“Your dream. The jealousy will fade fast.”
“Does this have anything to do with your experiment?”
“No, why?”
“Because it was a weird coincidence, that was so damn real, like it actually happened. I’ve never experienced a dream like that before. I can’t shake it.
The feelings persisted. I was in a jealous rage all day, battling what my logical side knew was a fantasy. Before we went to sleep, she asked me to strap on the device again, but I refused. Somehow, I knew there was a connection between the device and my dream, despite knowing how irrational that was.
It took a while to fall asleep. She was already snoring. I stared at the ceiling for at least an hour, then fatigue drew me into a deep and restful sleep that seemed like a long time—longer than eight hours. It’s hard to say. Then, consciously, I awoke. There, in the same white space with no up or down, no sense of boundary, witnessing without eyes, I replayed the trauma of her blatant infidelity. Desperation crept into me slowly as I realized it was not a dream, and I was not dreaming now. I was conscious, and trapped.
Then I realized the jealousy was gone. It didn’t matter. I realized she meant nothing to me. The sex didn’t matter either, and her psychological abuse could no longer touch me. In a very real sense, within this white prison, I was free. At least from her. The problem of getting out of this, whatever it was, remained.
The light in my white world began to shift with the passage of time. I knew there was a physical world beyond this space. I could hear it. Unlike my first experience, this torturous waking dream lasted the entire day.
It started getting dark, and I heard distant voices. There was animated conversation and commotion as the voices grew louder and came closer. To my shock and surprise, I recognized the male voice. It was mine.
“I’m taking it off,” my voice said. I heard the device drop to the floor.
“No! You can’t! Not before I reset it! There’s a problem! Put it back on!
Then with a plea that sounded final, she said, “Let me reset it. Please! Put it back on!”
Then words I would never say flew out, “You bitch! I’m going to kill you!” There was a blow and a body fell to the floor. Heavy breathing, and a computer beep was all I heard. I assumed my physical body had killed her, but I had no idea why. In a whisper that sounded like it was one inch away, I heard, “Now, I’m going to kill you,” my voice said to me.
I opened my clenched hand, and saw a crushed ping pong ball. There was Claire on the floor, bleeding, motionless.
The computer beeped, twice.

Young Jack isn’t a weak or inexperienced young man but he was having trouble concentrating. He wasn’t required to move the camera around as Becky knew the boundaries of her frame and was careful to keep them. It was the first take and all Jack had to do was watch for glitches while the girl begged for money. Young tanned olive-skinned, green-eyed sinuous beauty that Becky is doesn’t need to move during her pitch, but she does; seemingly random undulations reveal chasms between creamily squeezed breasts while the midriff allows bottom boobs to tease with the possibility of the total reveal. The softly furred tummy is a safer place to rest the eyes to prevent them from staring lewdly at her center, twitching and barely covered by low-rise tennis shorts sans panty lines.
“Cut?” she questions and Jack realizes she is talking to him.
“Huh, what?” he says.
“Is the message convincing? Is it compete?” she asks, approaching him while dropping the come hither act.
The message is just a recitation of their plight ending with a plea for funding. The four of them, Jack, Betsy, Ned, and Bao, have been given an intellectual and historic awareness in order to change the world to spare it from the impending doom of nuclear annihilation.
Ned and Maria are the owners of this large house, now their headquarters, and Maria is crossing the den on a housekeeping errand. She had stopped to watch, not affected as Jack had been. “I thought it was very persuasive,” she said.
“Yes, it should work,” Jack echoed as Marie continued on her way.
Betsy looked at Jack with concern.
“You think I am being immodest?” she asked.
“No! Of course not!”
“You know we don’t have much time! Ned’s getting fired and we don’t have the mortgage or the utilities and we’re losing the company cars. We need living money and enough seed money to set up our corporation. A woman using her wiles to milk the rubes is the only way to do that quick enough,” she said with conviction.
Jack had set up all the dozen accounts where he would broadcast her social media. It was taking longer to set up the advertising; it’s easy by design to set up payments far in excess of the income received. Now he is having reservations; Becky is so young and, obviously, innocent.
“You don’t like it. You. You’re exerting some kind of ownership over me, some protectionism,” she chided. “Don’t! We don’t have the time. Hmm, are you smitten with me? Well, it happens. To me, it happens a lot. I get the attention of ninety-year-old men receiving chemo in hospice! All men notice women who are able to bear their children, rated on unconscious cues and chemical triggers; forming them to race impetuously for the prize. That same designer allows women to maintain a clear head so they can logically choose which suiters to favor.”
“I guess so,” Jack said.
“Anyway, Jack, we have to work together, I need you a lot but there is a lot of tension. Sexual tension. I’ll do anything you want, anything you need. We must succeed! Do you want to go to my room?” she asked.
Jack looked down at her as she closed the gap between them to end up very close with her hand warmly circling his arm. His passion hadn’t embarrassed him earlier but if something didn’t happen soon conditions would manifest.
“I have work to do uploading,” he said, pulling away. He liked women. He had been in love and wouldn’t mind repeating that heated carnal passion even though it ended poorly. Living near the beach in Florida he had enjoyed many a dalliance with girls on vacation; they were similar in that they wanted a private memory and would indulge him with wanton abandon. They allowed him to coax them into loud and hysterical fits of pleasure. Looking into her wide brown eyes he saw neither love nor lust, warmth nor interest.
“Okay, I’ll change into business casual and we’ll do it again,” she said.
“I do appreciate it but I just don’t want to be serviced,” he blurted with more accusation than intended, causing her to stop and look at him again.
“It’s only proper, I need your services. I need your protection. I can promise satisfaction, I have rave reviews,” she teased and this time at least he saw some amusement.
“Maybe later,” he smiled. “Talking about protection, I’ll go through your contacts and filter out all the filth.”
“Just make sure you bring me the best offers,” she said.
“Why?” he laughed.
“After you check their identification we can set up appointments I’ll have to get a series of apartments,” she said.
“For what?”
“For whatever they want. Some will be satisfied with a home-cooked meal or a conversation. I’ll need someone to check for weapons, tools, or recorders.”
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying?” he said.
“Yes in a limited fashion. I don’t want to come home feeling like meatloaf.”
“I guess I am a bit old-fashioned. If they have enough money to burn they can be dangerous. Untouchable OJs, diplomatic immunity, feds?” he questioned.
“That’s where you come in. Are you crime-free as in carry permit?”
“You think I may have to kill someone?” he asked incredulously.
“Yes, maybe. We shouldn’t underestimate the forces of evil,” she said.
“Forces of what?”
“We have been empowered by a strong hand to do a good thing. Haven’t you considered the possibility that there is another side, unseen so far, aligned against us?”
“No.”
“Well, keep your eyes open. In the meantime filter out any political activists or professional sports. Filter anyone from a Narco state or collecting for a harem or the slave trade. Organ procurement gangs target prostitutes. It’s a tough job and it isn’t just for me - remember what is at stake here!” she enthused.
Jack balked, his mind whirling. Besty moved in the final inch, pressed herself against him, and put her free arm around the back of his neck.
“Please come with me,” she breathed.
Jack caved, his current willpower overcome, and allowed Betsy to lead him quickly up the stair and into the privacy of her room. After a short moment of tender embrace, Jack’s rage grew even past its previous limits. With motions defined at the beginning of human time, he pounded some sense into her. His trepidation, fear, frustrations, and uncertainty were all changed to motion, almost brutal, and she, like women are designed to do, pleasurably absorbed his testosterone-fueled outburst into her very core.
Soon, she rose and stood over him, her visage already renewing his ardor.
‘I have to shower and dress in business casual,” she said while offering him a drowsily satiated smile that he could have spent the entire day pecking kisses at. “I don’t think you need to supervise this time. I can do it. Are you going to get that permit today?”
Jack appreciated the tact with which it took place but, in the end, it was a bum rush. He left with pleasant memories while she was in the shower to find Ned traversing the hall.
“I was looking for you,” he said and motioned for Jack to follow him back into the dining area. He took a seat at the eight place table, which had been cleared of adornments. Recently, Ned had enjoyed placement in upper management of the truck division of a rental company and owned this large house they were now headquartered in. Maria, his wife, provided polite but reluctant support and his three teens didn’t seem to notice much outside of their circle of friends.
“How’s Bao doing?” Jack asked.
The team had a sense that an artificial intelligence left by an ancient civilization existed in the solar system. If they could enlist it to their cause that super brain may be able to provide a solution. Realizing the remote chance of success, they needed to find the stealthed object, teach it English, and convince it to help them save a world it didn’t care about. Bao had gone to China to hammer out a deal for Asian programmers to make the interface.
“He called,” said Ned. “Only hours off the plane and he has an appointment with the head viability and procurement officers at China North Industries tomorrow morning, which will be tonight.”
“Is that a good place?” 
“It depends on what you mean by good. They are the largest armament manufacturer in China!” Ned stated.
“Deep, deep pockets then. Willing to take a chance? I thought big companies were stiff in that regard, worried about their reputation, what message was sent, and other bullshit. Northrop or Boeing would never entertain even the idea of such a search.”
“Well, to be fair, the idea is ridiculous and approval of expenditures on it could end a career,” Ned declared.
“So why does Bao have an appointment with Chinese R&D?”
“Bao has a theory. He called a friend of his and got a call back from the department head within half an hour, in the evening, after hours,” Ned enthused. “Rumor has it that a UFO crashed near a small fishing village where the people nursed, befriended, fed, and returned the two surviving aliens resulting in mutual contact. Confirmation is need-based but not covered up like any similar circumstance would be in the US.”
“I thought the Chinese were very secretive,” Jack said.
“They are with us, with others. They have a strong national pride. There is a lot of trust among the population. It seems China North may have a heads up on alien stuff that has been shared with everyone,” Ned theorized.
“If the Apollo, for instance, missions found some evidence of alien activity they wouldn’t tell us, would they?” Jack asked.
“I can’t be sure but I don’t believe they would tell us anything.”
“I believe you,” Jack confessed, “but I don’t understand why. We paid for the exploration and alien stuff is what we kind of hoped for. Is this misdirection for our own good?”
“My ass! Any discoveries will be fought over by the elites in position at the time. There’s no estimating how much alien information could be worth!” groused Ned.
“Yeah, I was encouraged when private companies got into space but I don’t think they will provide a free reveal either. Anyway, what do you think we should do to avoid the impending doom?” asked Jack.
“Well, oil is the obvious flashpoint. I was thinking we could do something about energy,” Ned mused.
“Like designing a new battery car?” Jack questioned.
“Nah, in my opinion, that’s just a waste of time. You’re adding a huge inefficient explosive weight to the transport. It burns more gas to make the electricity needed to charge the battery than it does to run the car. Ridiculous!,” Ned stated.
“Should we promote recyclables then?” Jack asked.
“Hmm. Both wind and sun devices are clunky, heavy, and take a lot of power to make. They are dependent on the weather and require battery storage.”
“So that’s waste too?” Jack said. Did he remember something about some kind of a solution? 
“That depends. If we put the solar and wind collectors out of the way, in deserts and out to sea instead of pumping electricity into batteries or expensive new lines, we can add cheap machines right at the solar or wind site. The machine will change water and electricity to hydrogen. We can ship the compressed gas by truck, ship, rail, or pipe much like oil. We can use existing stations to fuel hydrogen cars.”
“Ah! That’s the rub. It’ll take decades to develop them!” Jack spewed.
Ned shook his head. “Nope, hydrogen is a teeny molecule so gaskets and hoses have to be made with new materials. It burns at a higher temperature than gas, so better metal has to be used in the motors. That’s about it. There are working cars and support already out there.”
“Seems like I have heard all of this before,” Jack said.
“Worth repeating!” 
“Do you think we should back hydrogen?” Jack asked.
“Maybe but it’s common. To make money real fast you have to bypass the usual route,” Ned said.
“Are you sure?”
“No. But I have had a niggling for a while now, an idea. What about a superconducting capacitor? You charge it up with a years’ worth and plug it into the car or into the house or even a plane. About the size of a discus weighing ten pounds. Huh?” proposed Ned.
“What’s up?” Becky said, having finished her business casual pitch. She took a seat and Jack filled her in on Ned’s power pack idea.
“You say you have a hunch?” she asked and Ned confirmed it.
“Sounds good to me. That could change the energy dynamic which might delay the war long enough for us to get our hands on a long-term solution,” she added.
“All right, we’re agreed,” Ned said. “I’ll set up the research corporation. We’ll worry about production when we have a working model. Betsy’s going to be our angel and Jack’s going to assist her until we see real money with our energy business.”
Maria brought in a tray of hot coffee but even so Ned was rising. “I might as well get started. I’ll file the papers and see if I can get some decent office space. Bao said to check out hoteling with hotdesks for fifty temps at a nearby place. Later.”
“Do you think you can get those vids uploaded today?” Becky asked.
“I can get to some of them. I have to be at the range at 4,” Jack told her.
“Range?”
“For the gun permit. Turns out a few lessons are required.”
“Did you tell him what you needed the permit for?” she asked.
“Yes. I told him I needed to protect a high-end escort I figured it was best not to lie.”
“What did he recommend?”
“He said I couldn’t do anything more dangerous. He said I would probably have to use one of the guns before long. He said I should get two guns; the first, a 45 caliber Smith and Wesson in a well-fitted underarm holster. The second would be a 38 caliber derringer.”
Betsy frowned. “That’s a lot of close firepower! Why so much?”
“He said someone will get enamored with my girl and try to push past me while drawing a gun. The 38 should be in my hand when the client approaches and while I search him. If I see trouble, I push it into his chest and fire before he can get a bead. The 45 will finish him off quick; and his friends. He said I need a plan for the meat and the noise beforehand.”
Betsy’s eyes were wide. “Really?”
“That’s what the gun guy said.”
“Maybe we should call this off?” she offered.
“No. Remember the stakes. Besides, it’s just as dangerous for you.”
She nodded. “When you find the apartment make sure you install hidden cameras and mikes. Keep an eye on me,” she ordered.
“You know, it’s important to me that I get through life without hurting others. Now, the gun guy says I will probably kill someone.”
“We’re human. I believe in people, we need to survive. We have to stand for good people everywhere,” she explained.
“Let’s get started,” he said after a moment.

To Joseph L. Mundigler, 
I recently came across your incredibly scathing opinion piece regarding the creation of THOUGHT and it’s negative impact on a global scale. The statistics you referenced were accurate enough, and your collection of firsthand testimonials from former THOUGHT users was a nice touch. I agree with your perspective (though, not wholly), which may come as a surprise to you, considering I’m the creator of the drug you criticize so vehemently. There is, however, one thing you got wrong and I feel it is imperative that the mistake be corrected (and do feel free to publish my response in your next column. Consider this my written consent.). 
In paragraph three, you wrote: “While I disagree with the creation and continued use of THOUGHT, and while I believe he was reckless in creating the drug, I do not count the drugs creator, Dr. Michael Jennings, on my long list of mad scientists.”
Mad scientist. I admit, I ruminated on the phrase for a while. I rolled the words around on my tongue just to see how they tasted. The thing is, when I created THOUGHT, I was mad. Mad at the world, mad at crooked politicians, mad at the war and all it had taken from me. I’ve never denied my anger. I was always a mad scientist, and I’ve never once claimed to be anything else. THOUGHT was born to a mad scientist because THOUGHT was the dream of a mad boy. I’ll tell you why:
He came back a different man, my father. He left when I was young and when he returned, I figured my job being man of the house was over. I thought he would pick up where he left off. I thought we’d go back to being the kind of family that sat down to dinner together. None of that happened. Only when I learned more about the war did I realize what I fool I had been to hope for normalcy. My father was no longer normal, and the atrocities of war had made it so. Here’s the thing we often forget about war — when a man returns from war, he brings his ghosts back with him.
I spent all of my free time trying to understand my father, studying him the way a young boy might study a wild animal. I kept a safe distance. The smallest noise would bring him back to the jungles. The slightest inconvenience would trigger his predatory instinct. If he wasn’t posted in front of the television with a tv dinner on a folding tray, I had to tread light and breathe quiet. I had only ever been on the receiving end of his anger once, and once was all it took for me to learn my lesson.
Still, I wanted to know where his ghosts came from. He’d scream in his sleep. He’d shout the names of people I had never heard of before. He’d go into the bathroom and cry for hours, begging his God for relief. Or maybe he was begging for release. It could’ve been either or, because both relief and release would have set him free from his ghosts. That was all he really wanted.
When I wasn’t studying my father, I was studying science. All kinds of science: biology, chemistry, psychology, and physics (I even played around in astronomy for a time, but my problems were of this world, so astronomy became more of a spare hobby). I overachieved and excelled, all because I wanted to understand my father. I wanted to see his ghosts. I wanted to take them from him so that he could know peace again. I thought I could save him from the things I couldn’t see and the horrors I couldn’t imagine. Horrors my father lived through and would never talk about. The horrors that made the ghosts. 
I was still in high school when I created THOUGHT. It was made in my basement with a science kit my mother had given to me for my sixteenth birthday. I won’t go into detail about how I acquired the necessary chemicals to create the drug, nor will I divulge what those ingredients are (this is not an instructional piece and my creation has been debased quite enough). THOUGHT was the perfect answer to the questions I had been asking for much of my young life.
It took weeks to convince my father to try a THOUGHT. He was skeptical at best, and morbidly suspicious at worst. He caved, eventually, when he realized that years of prayer had done nothing to save him from his ghosts. What do I got to lose? my father mumbled when he finally agreed. Nothing, I told him. Nothing at all.
He didn’t care what THOUGHT he took so I chose for him. I gave him peace because it was the only thing I wanted for him. He swallowed the pill and chased it with a swig of whiskey (water turned to whiskey after the war). A few short minutes later, my father sat wide-eyed on the couch in a dreamland, wearing a smile I hadn’t seen since I was a young boy. Since before the war. Since before the ghosts. He was seeing and feeling peace, and it was finally real to him — even though it was only in his mind. I couldn’t see what peace looked like to him, but I could feel that it was in him. He was immersed in it so fully that he fell asleep in his peace. When he woke up a few hours later, his posture had straightened ever so slightly and there was a small bounce in his step. He was still wicked, mind you, but he was lighter. Whatever peace was in his mind, it was exactly what he needed. 
My father continued treatment, ingesting a THOUGHT once a week. In a matter of months, the screaming stopped. The crying and the begging stopped. The triggers and the rage stopped. My father turned into the version of himself he would’ve been if not for the war. Make no mistake — it was my anger at his ghosts that made THOUGHT possible.
My father died a mildly happy, old man. He didn’t become a perfect person, and THOUGHT wasn’t a perfect drug back then (it was still in it’s trial phase), but I was able to give my mother a few more good years before he passed. I was able to rid him of his ghosts, and that was all I really wanted. 
Now, my point. First, I remind you, as I have reminded countless others over the years, that my intention and the drugs purpose can be found in it’s name: THOUGHT — Therapeutic Hallucinations Observed Under Guided Higher Therapy. THOUGHT does more than provide alterations in cognitive patterns. THOUGHT gives us a glimpse into the human brain and it’s formerly unknown system (now known as the Projector). By administering a Type II Xonex IV into the brain stem, researchers are now able to bear witness to the cognitive patterns, personal thoughts, images, and scenarios that the patient experiences with THOUGHT. This insight provides researchers with valuable information needed to improve disruptive and damaging cognitive patterns and, ultimately, helps to heal the traumatized brain.
Second, THOUGHT was designed to treat mental health disorders such as PTSD, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, OCD, phobias, and more. Data gathered from countless longitudinal studies have shown positive effects on patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries — specifically injuries that left patients comatose. THOUGHT was also successful in treating degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease, which was far more than I could have hoped for. 
Third, how the drug is used and abused recreationally is well out of my hands (I do, however, encourage the concerned to write to their local politicians regarding the ethics and morality behind the government regulation of life-saving medicines). I stand by this fact and refuse any and all blame for how society chooses to medicate itself. Labeling me reckless will not shift the blame in my direction because the blame is not mine.
Lastly, know that I do not write this with the intention of changing your mind. Your disdain for the drug is clear and I’m quite aware you’re not looking for an unsolicited debate. I’m only writing so as not to confuse you or mislead any of your readers about who I am. 
Put plainly: I am a mad scientist, sir. I have always been. My creations are the results of my curiosity and frustration, mixed together in one mad mind. This is true of all scientists. If we are not pushed by our anger at the world, we are pushed by the limits the world imposes. We are mad enough to meet those limits and break them. I ask that you not insult me by pretending to spare my feelings. Count me among them, Mr Mundigler. Count me among the mad scientists because that is what I am. 
Signed,
Michael Jennings, MD., PhD.

“If you want to have a conversation, we’ll do it properly.” The tenant said, “Not through an intercom.”
“Mrs. Marabel, it’s hardly necessary to-”
The door buzzed and the latch clanked open. The Weaver synched the straps on his mask, and snapped a fresh pair of gloves over his hands. 
When he stepped off the elevator he identified her apartment immediately, the Loom was still outside her door, upright and strapped to the dolly like a forgotten refrigerator. The words, “Weave with Convivia” stamped across the side. He hesitated for a moment outside her door. He checked his mask again, and tugged on the gloves once more to make sure they were on tight, then knocked.
The woman who answered the door was…imperfect. Mrs. Marabel was not ugly. Not dirty. But also, not perfect. It was an unusual thing for him to see. 
She stuck out her hand. He hesitated, but took it cautiously. “Everly Marabel.” She said.
He nodded, then stepped through the door. “Mrs. Marabel, I’m here because a Loom was delivered to you but you’ve requested we take it back.”
“Well, Yes.” She said walking past him to open a cupboard, She pulled out a stocky glass pitcher with black handle and lid. “It’s been outside my door for more than a month.”
“You don’t want it?” He said. He dragged a chair out from under the kitchen table and sat. 
“No.” She said, “I told them that the day they delivered it.” 
“You don’t want to be woven?”
“No.” She said. Then she held up a stiff rectangular bag. “Coffee?” She asked. 
The Weaver noted its pleasant aroma. “Uh, sure.” 
“No,” She continued, “I have no interest in being woven, or linked, or integrated, or whatever else you are calling it these days.”
He set a document on the table. “Mrs. Marabel, If you truly want to sign this Declination to Accept letter, I’ll add it to your file and be on my merry way, but my duty mandates that I encourage you otherwise before I accept your signature. Think about it. There is no other way to connect.”
“I don’t think that’s true. What are we doing right now?”
He didn’t answer.
“Connecting.” She said, as she handed him a mug. 
He reached out and took it. “The Loom is the only way to stay connected and be protected.” Even as he said it he realized he was unintentionally quoting the Convivia commercials.
“So I’ve heard.” 
“Are you aware that it is being provided to you free of charge?” He removed a rubber straw from his pocket and attached one end to a small depression in his mask and plopped the other end in the mug. “It’s backed by government subsidies. It’ll be of no cost to you.”
“I don’t care.” She said, “It’s not real life. Life doesn’t go in a box, unless it’s cereal. I’m not cereal. So I will not get inside the box.” 
He could tell it was a joke by the smirk on her face, but he didn’t get it— no clue what she meant. “Ma’am, it’s hardly just a box. It’s a luxury-grade neural link to the rest of the world. With the lockdowns, it’s not only a means to connect, but to be free, to escape. In a moment, you could be in Barcelona, or better yet, Dubai.” He smiled. It was genuine. But she couldn’t see it behind his mask. “It’s lovely, truly lovely there.”
“Really, “ She said. “Have you been?” 
“I have,” he said.”I just left there this morning.”
“Intriguing. What did you do while you were there?”
“I visited The World Archipelago.” He said. Then he took a sip of his coffee. “It’s lovely.”
“The coffee, or the islands?”
“The islands.” He said. “They have a cluster of islands patterned after the continents of the Earth. It’s breathtaking. 
Mrs. Marabel took a slow controlled sip of her coffee. “Go on.”
“You can’t tell when you’re on the island, or one of the beaches, but as you ascend above it, boy it’s a wonder. I took a perspective-shot last night. Of the view. It was stunning.”
Weaver tapped the computer mounted to his forearm, and the screen woke up. “See, look at this.” With a gesture the dark image dripped from his forearm like an oil spill, and covered her entire table. 
“Those are The World Archipelago Islands.” He said, his face beaming with recollection. “See them? Dazzling city lights speckle the continents like stars. It’s extraordinary. You see?”
“Yes, I see, quite dazzling.”
“Despite the virus, despite the lockdown, you can see the world. Connect.” He took another sip of the coffee, then set it down on the table. “I take pride in my job, Mrs. Marabel. We are reuniting humanity. Yangtze has taken its toll on us, unstitched the bond we once had with each other. Human society was unraveled by the virus, but Convivia has a solution. 
“You’re talking about that AI program? We’re getting our solution from a computer program?”
“Yes, Convivia. He designed the Looms, He knows how to use them to knit us back together again. Don’t you want that? Human connection? He is weaving us anew.”
“Oh, give me a break!” Mrs. Marabel said. “The Yangtze virus isn’t the problem. The technology is. The virus isn’t unraveling us. Our willingness to exchange real human interaction with a digital shadow of it, that’s unraveling us.” 
“Ah, there you go.” The Weaver said, looking a little deflated by her unimpressed expression. “The stereotypical D.T.A.’s response. Somehow human interaction for the woven is inferior because it is digitized or remote.”
“It’s inferior because humans aren’t digital.” Mrs. Marabel said. “It was bad enough when we all carried around computers in our hands, but now that we have to undergo such invasive procedures just to connect…I see the end coming.” 
She looked at the Weaver, straight into his eyes. Her imperfections, subtle as they were, unsettled him. Not because they were offensive, but because they were endearing. It occurred to him that it was the first real face he’d seen with his own eyes in ages. 
She continued. “We’ve been sitting here, in the flesh, in front of each other for several minutes now, and you’ve yet to introduce yourself. This was once a standard social norm, lost by avatars, labels, and profile links that rendered human greetings obsolete.” 
She stood up. “But this isn’t obsolete!” She gestured to the situation, the table, the coffee, their physical presence. “But given enough time in that thing,” She regarded the box on her doorstep with disgust, an upright coffin, “all of this, will be made obsolete.” She turned and dumped her coffee down the sink. “No, Mr. Who-ever-you-are, Mr. Weaver, I will not be woven. I decline to accept.” She marched over to the table and scribbled her signature on the page. 
The Weaver stood up. Flustered. Embarrassed, perhaps because he failed to persuade her, or perhaps because he had indeed failed to introduce himself. He turned towards the door, fastened the straps on his mask even tighter, then spoke.
“If you change your mind, and would like to see The World Islands lit up at night, just let me know and I’ll be happy to perform the initial weaving procedures myself.”
She marched past him and opened the door. “And if you ever want to come back and have a real conversation, over real coffee again, you know where to find me.”
He said nothing, he tugged on his gloves until he was satisfied they were on tight, and walked right past her. 
“Oh,” She added, “Just so you know, I’ve been to The World Islands before…and to the Galapagos, and the Spice Islands, and Hawaii. And I’ve seen the archipelago at night from the window seat of an Emirates flight, twice. But the Islands in Dubai were always my least favorite. You know why?”
He stopped, but he didn’t turn back or speak. 
“Because they’re manufactured, Mr. Weaver, just like the experiences in your precious Loom. The real World Archipelago was never populated, and has no lights. They spent 10 Billion dollars, and 23 years, but all the islands will ever be, is a shadow. Yes, Mr. Weaver, even dazzling lights can be shadows.”

Andy Sorkin tensed the marginal muscle that corded his arms.
His physique was in the past, lost with the internecine of the war.
Could do with a pump, he thought, turning around to admire his back.
Artistry. That’s what his body was – used to be, he corrected.
Every contour that ribbed his back, delineated with days of his life.          
Roids was a familiar word. Spoken by the insecure. But it was always complimentary the way he heard it. Au naturel, baby. Strip me from skin and bone, he’d say.
What you see is hand-crafted excellence, made by me and none other. This was sacrifice, a product of the trope; blood and sweat and tears.
For what? For nuclear war-heads to radiate the land, sap life and everything that came with it. He would feel sadness, but not like he used to. No one could.
Andy had one vial left - Elation. About time I pay Lester a visit, he noted, a new batch had just been brewed. A couple of Dejections would do him well. It would balance out the high. He hated that word, but it was the common term coined and now associated between all users.
Lifting didn’t come with the same rush it used to. There was no reason anymore, other than hypertrophy. But he couldn’t enjoy that without dosing-up.
He looked outside of his flat window. The thirty-fifth floor bragged the verticality of the city, both above and below surface. There were sewer dwellers, occupants of the dark, those who took shelter during the war and found no reason to return to light. A sad life. Of course, they wouldn’t know it, especially with their vials of Elation. They over-indulged on it, anything to erase the reality of which they lived.
A younger Andy would be giddy at the height of these buildings. Even as a kid he chased the rush. He never sought for anything artificial, only what came naturally. Drugs were tempting. They could give a rush unmatched by others. It wasn’t real, he’d tell himself.
What he’d feel would be superficial. And that wouldn’t do. The buildings provided a solution. With a group of friends, waiting until dark, past the eyes of curious onlookers, he’d scale the buildings and stand over the edge. That was all he asked for now. That feeling.
Lester was shacked-up in the same spot in the mouth of the sewer entrance. It was a safe location. No members of authority would tread too far below surface. That was because most people down there were happy-heads; those who obsessively used Elation as a means to feel something. They never caused trouble.
Lester saw Andy approaching and opened the back doors of his van. From the outside, it was a hick piece of trash, but the inside was polished white.
“Got a new load in. Chucked in a couple of Wrath’s. Might wanna get your hands on these quickly. A group of mercenaries were planning to go up to the capital and cause a scene.”
“I’m fine,” said Andy.
“Really? Thought that was straight up your alley. There’s no rush like setting fire to the embassy. Shit, they won’t get that far. You know they’ve increased undercover cops? Can’t say anything bad about our rulers.” His eyes darted past Andy and around the tunnel.
“No bugs down here,” said Andy.
“You’re right. I just get worried. Tuck got bagged the other night. They came in his house and all when he was asleep.”
“What did he say?”
“Something about President Wilkson looking like the ass-end of a bulldog. Nothing even about their policies. So I gotta be careful about who I’m selling to. Never know when a cop will come down here and start prying.”
Andy nodded but refrained from furthering the conversation.
“Sorry,” said Lester, “what’ya want?”
His stock varied in quality, lingering between mediocre and subpar.
“You got a couple of Dejections that could last me longer than a day?”
Lester fished through the crates of vials before revealing a neat box with a pneumatic seal.
He opened it and a cryogenic steam crept out.
“This is it. Nicked right off an X-Meds truck.”
They mass-produced vials of the highest grade. No one below surface would ever dream of affording one. It was a prerogative of the higher class: doctors, lawyers, even politicians.
“I hate to be holding these,” said Lester, “especially within my own home grown. It’s this damn corporation that sucks me dry. Every newly improved vial they drop is another pain in my balls. Other sellers with a scrap more knowledge know how to break down the formula and produce a travesty that’s still better than mine. I was a bio-chem undergrad before the war. It ain’t my fault the world went tits-up before I graduated. Who cares, I wouldn’t be able to feel a damn thing if it wasn’t for that there.”
He was red faced, scratched his arm nervously and pointed to a hunk of sleek metal the size of a record-player. Lester’s sensory pad was placed in the disc-like hole reserved for it. Above it, a vial was suspended by metal prongs, and second by second, drips were fed onto the pad. On the underside of his arm was a pad similar to the one in the machine. It gleamed a dull blue and meant the connection was sufficient.
“Sorry if I’m acting like this. I just came off a three day high on Elation. I needed something to anchor me down. Don’t wanna end up like the happy-heads.”
The dull blue was Dejection, and inside the box that Lester presented, a varied assortment of colours stood out to him, each stimulating feelings of their own.
“I’ll take what you’re having.”
“Home brew or corporate?”
I have the pocket to afford the latter, he thought, but would I rather spend that on ultimate decline or ascension? After a down of corporate quality, any hand-produced vial of Elation would launch him into Nirvana.
“Corporate.”
Lester sighed. “Just don’t get hooked and start buying from the company. It’s good shit, I can tell you that. But they’re also my competition. And besides, you’re a loyal customer.”
Andy felt a twinge in his stomach. There was unrest. He dug through his pockets to pull out cash, but his eyes were glazed with indignation.
“Don’t call me that.” The response was impulsive.
Lester winced in shock.
He wanted to mollify Lester with an apology, but nothing came out. His remark was unprovoked. Maybe it’s the effects of the last Dejection vial lingering in my system, he thought.
“Don’t call you what?”
“A loyal customer.”
“But it’s true. You’re one of my best.” His face languishing with Dejection.
Andy looked at the vials with disgust. He was tempted to smash them all, watch them spill over the ground and go to waste. But he needed them. Just as much as every other person.
“I don’t want to be that customer,” he said while pulling out a handful of cash, “I hate myself every time I come down here.”
He handed over the money and Lester apprehensively handed him back an X-Med vial.
Andy looked at the viscous liquid and stashed it into his pocket, his eyes dour and downcast.
“How the hell do we take this stuff and feel content?” he asked.
"It’s an essential. Just like the air we breathe and the food we shit out. It empowers everything. If it wasn’t for this,” he said, pointing back to his machine, “we’d all end up as Ghosts. Tell me, you wanna live like that? Wandering the streets with nothing to live for, nothing to feel, no will to feed yourself until you keel over and die. You’re saying that’s better?”
Andy often questioned the validity of his beliefs. Post-war, when vials were first distributed across cities, he refrained with intention of adhering to past ideas – a natural life, one that was never influenced artificially. Even when social media was prominent, the feeling he’d get, the pleasure, it wasn’t real, unlike the mawkish rush of climbing buildings and lifting weights.
“It’s not better. It’s temporary. It’s artificial and we have it relayed into us every damn day. We’re addicted.”
“Addicted to emotion?” primed Lester, “addicted to feeling human? It lets us remember. We live our life in shadows down here because no one wants to face the light up there.”
“But it opposes everything that makes us human. We are dependent on a drug.”
He remembered being under the bar and feeling the pump.
Roids. Maybe it was true. These were no stimulants for the muscle, but the mind.
“Perhaps you’re right. We’re reliant on it. Are you ashamed of yourself for taking the vials?”
Andy’s silence was taken as a yes.
“Everyone does it, other than the ghosts. Our cabinet of leaders are hooked on the stuff, even President Wilkinson. Why else do you think they spout their shit with a happy smile? They get premium grade, best of the best vials. A high we couldn’t even dream of.”
“Sometime I wonder how bad it is to be a Ghost.”
“I know you’ve read the articles. They’re emotionless, not present in this life or any other. They live for nothing.”
“Do you not think it would be worth giving this up,” asked Andy, sparing the vial a glance.
Lester grimaced. An insult to his stock and his life. It ain’t my concern what you do, but if you give this up, you’re a stupid sonofabitch.”
He could abstain, deprive himself of dosing up. But that just meant the inevitability of taking any vial would be so much stronger. There were people who did it, bound by an ascetic lifestyle. But even with their minimal doses, they weren’t content, just barely passing the days.
There was an unfeigned giggle. They both turned. A man dressed in bright colours; a red jumper and yellow sweat pants, brought with him a sartorial imbalance.
Andy, in his greys and blacks, ignored him.
“Hey, Seth,” called Lester.
The man gave a child-like smile. Superficial, noted Andy. His eyes were forlorn, an empty canvas waiting to be painted on.
“Lemme guess,” said Lester as he rummaged through the back of the van. Seth stumbled over like a boozer, a pre-war state. Lester pulled out a carboard box labelled home brew, and placed it on the fold-up table. Seth looked inside and said, “six, please.” His manners made him an aberration, even more than that stupid smile he constantly wore, thought Andy. A Happy-head’s behaviour was deplorable.
It was a lack of self-control. Soon, when their tolerance would build and they didn’t have enough cash for something with a stronger kick, they’d become a Ghost.
A cycle of fate. Was it worth it, questioned Andy. To give up and pass after an almighty high, but in those final moments, suffer something that no human had lived to tell.
Seth paid and stashed them in a plastic bag.
He looked past Lester and into the truck. It was the machine. His smile turned inward, preoccupied with the colour of the vial.
“Why go through that?” asked Seth, “you can take this and be like me.”
The steady flow of Dejection to Lester’s sensory pad made him spiteful.
“Because I want to be alive next year.”
Seth’s face was wooden. Andy watched from the side-lines. Seth laughed, “I will be. See you next week, Lester.” He walked out of the sewer mouth, his footsteps light as if about to engage a tango, a propensity that all Happy-heads inclined towards.
In his apartment, Andy fixed his sensory pad to the machine and hooked up the vial. He adjusted the dial, turning it to six drips per minute. It was a lot. He didn’t take into account their potency. Screw it, he thought. He was aware of the low it would bring him. But he didn’t care. Maybe the last vial he took was wearing off, or maybe he was sick of this ritualistic routine. The secondary pad on his underarm glowed its gentle blue. He breathed deep. The connection had been made.
Andy walked to the window and stripped off his shirt before the feeling of depression that abounded had overwhelmed him. It was strong. He started to sweat.
In a lapse of judgement, he thought of the past. Wanted it, desperately. A mistake.
His perspiration landed him on the bench beneath the barbell, his muscles pumped and his mind clear. He looked at his reflection in the window.
Have I lost weight, he asked himself. Of course, you have, idiot.
His pride, in the most inhumane way, had been taken. After years of tentative care for his body, it took a day for him to wake up and see nothing of himself. That day, despite his sheer size, he felt nothing. There was no motive to pick up another weight. At that point he was closest to becoming a ghost.
He despised the vials. But it was worth it, enduring the artificial and unnatural, if it meant that he could feel once more. Andy ruminated in the past. The strangest thing about Dejection was that it didn’t give you bad thoughts, at least not for him. It made him think of what he missed, what he had, and how it was here no longer. He looked past the window and at the buildings, trying his best to dismiss his poor reflection.
I wonder how the mercenaries were doing, he thought, hooked up on Wrath, marching through the streets like rampant animals, awaiting their inevitable capture. This oppressive rule under a despotic leadership was a unifying bond between him and the thousands of others in the city. There were no means to oppose, not even temporarily in acts of violence. It was the government that allowed the production of vials. Without the emotional stimulants, they’d have no bait to hook in their food. Andy looked upon the meal of civilians in the city below. He remembered something Lester said the other week; we’re a couple of Androids flying in from Mars away from a Dick novel. It was true. At what point did fiction cross into reality.
The pad on his underarm took a more vibrant shade of blue. The drips were powerful. Lester warned me, he reflected. But I know what I’m doing. He jigged the handle on the window until it opened and a great wind swept into the room. Andy could mope around all day, but it wouldn’t be long before he resorted to a neutral, ghost-like state.
“At least I felt something to the end.”
He stepped out onto the window seal.
In that moment he felt more human than he ever had before.

“Dr. G says it’s a body of our ancestors,” his assistant clarified, shouting over the rotors of their chopper. 
Hojo looked over his notes thoroughly, again and again, attempting to make out the photographs of the “phenomenal” discovery his college friend had the luck to find. His long, dark hair fell over his bony white fingers, tracing lines along a certain photo of a creature with pale, blue skin, lying inside what appeared to be a metal coffin. 
Our ancestors didn’t fall from space, he thought. Or else, there would be, certainly, a lot more craters on this planet. 
He sorted the photos, reviewing them while his assistant kept informing with, “Whatever it is, they should be close to extracting it from its vessel.”
This caught Hojo by surprised. He turned his tiny eyes sharply to the young man. 
“Is that wise? What about possible disease and exposure?”
The young man cleared his throat, bowing his head to dodge Hojo’s typical hard stare. 
“Well, that’s a risk Dr. G is willing to take,” he replied nervously. 
Hojo scoffed and looked away from his assistant’s tense face. 
“Of course, he is,” the bitter scientist muttered. He glared at the photos once more, seeing his once, old friend, smile right at him. Dr. G’s teeth were always straight, and he always had a youthful face, his eyes bright with pride behind square lenses. 
“We're coming in soon at eleven o’clock. Buckle your seat belts,” the pilot announced. The chopper began to descend. 
His assistant pointed gladly at the distant view. 
“There it is!”
Hojo stared through the window, taking in a crater so massive and ancient, it became a part of the Planet. Rugged black rock propelled so high from a blast long ago, creating an almost wide mouth volcano like projection, with snow and ice all along its outer walls. The winds grew rough, juggling the chopper as they neared. The crater expelled waves of green light, pulsing outward like gushing green fog, an endless generator. 
Free energy, just spitting out into the air, Hojo thought, amazed at the natural formation. A chill snuck into the chopper, urging the scientist to zip up his long coat. They did warn of ice. 
After landing, Hojo and his assistant made for a bumpy descend. They simply followed the lanterns planted by Dr. G’s team, spiraling down further and further. Bodies of monsters laid to waste, increasing Hojo’s nerves. He turned away from hard skin and bullet holes, along with puddles of blood around the trail. 
The farther they went, the thicker the air, filled with more loose energy until it seemed electrifying. Rough winds shot up through the cracks in the earth, acting as geysers for more green fog. 
“So much energy!” His assistant sang, marveled. 
It was at least a mile down the crater, unable to go as linear as Hojo had hoped, too steep for the matter. They had to circle it like a drain. Hojo breathed into his gloves, warming his hands. His red cheeks stung of cold, lips trembling. The fur trim around his coat did nothing to soothe the chill sneaking into his collar. There should have been more layers. 
Walls of rock and ice, eventually turned into crystal, until it was like walking into a world of broken mirrors. 
Hojo knew he was close when he heard the voices of the team ahead. He quickened his pace, his thin body unable to do more than a light jog. 
“Dr. G, your friend is here,” someone shouted. 
Hojo walked into a cavern of crystal, lanterns to make it seem like the sun was in there with them all. He squinted to such light, bulbs reflected easily in many angles. 
Dr. G turned around from the dig site. When he straightened and saw that it was Hojo, a warm smile formed on his smooth face. 
“Eriko! My old friend! I’m so glad you could make it!” The other scientist cheered. 
Hojo tried to smile, but doing so felt foreign to him. His struggles with finding a company to support his research has been carved into his once, young face. The bags under his eyes loathed Dr. G’s bright smile and fine complexion. A man always with a mission. 
Hojo was constantly looking for his. Still haven’t found it. 
“Fare, what’s this all about?” Hojo enquired, ignoring his old college’s wide arm hug. Fare dropped his arms with disappointment, but he smirked anyway. 
“Still a stiff, like in grad school. How’s the world treating you?” He laid a warm hand on Hojo’s small shoulder like they were lab partners again, competing for the highest grade, and yet, got along like friends. At least, a long time ago. Hojo’s eyes steered to that hand like it burned his shoulder, but said nothing of it. To answer the question, he muttered, “It’s fine.” He said it with so much distaste, even Fare couldn’t ignore it.
“Still can’t find a company to hire you?”
“No,” Hojo simmered. 
There was a pat on his shoulder, and then a chuckle. 
“Well, what if I told you, I could get you a job? I’ve found something big, Eriko, big! Come and see!”
Fare began to trek the hard earth path, his white lab coat flailing behind him like a hero’s cape. Hojo clenched his teeth as he followed. 
“Fare, please stop calling me by my first name,” he insisted. He looked to the walls, seeing many clones of himself just staring into his eyes, dozens of him frowning and eyes so puny behind such round glasses. All the studying and reading behind poor lighting left Hojo to wear such thick spectacles. His black hair remained short, though it seemed to have grown some behind his ears. His beard was growing out again, giving him that five o’clock shadow look. He was lacking on his hygiene lately, too busy searching for any company to hire him. There’s no living for a jobless scientist. 
With a hiss, Hojo looked away sharply from his reflections, and continued to follow. 
“I work for this company that’s willing to put more research into this discovery. What if this is one of our ancestors? What if this is proof we all came from space? Think of the possibilities!” Fare preached, his boots crunching along loose pebbles and crystals. 
Finally, his boots stopped along the edge of a slope, and the bright man peered down, the lights glimmering over his lenses. 
“There she is.”
Hojo stepped beside him and had a look. His eyes widened. 
It happened instantly, like the specimen knew of his weakened soul, though the bitter scientist was unaware of it as soon as he laid his dilated pupils upon her. 
Such a beautiful creature, with a face of a woman, eyes closed behind thin, blue skin, her gorged breasts stretched with veins. There was a torso, and what began to look as arms and legs, but they scattered off like long, fat vines coiled behind her like a bed. Her cocoon appeared to be a one man metal pod, its thick window covered in frost. Though Hojo could see clearly through that glass, lost in what slept behind it. 
Out of nowhere, wind slipped between his legs and under his arms, ruffling his thick coat while setting out to push him forward. His black hair lifted, face kissed by cold. His white cloud breath faded to her tomb below.
And then her voice came. 
You are precisely who I need.
Hojo spun around, searching for the voice of sirens, an angelic choir suddenly in the site, though he only saw the puzzled look on his colleague’s face. 
“Eriko, are you all right?”
Hojo gasped, looking back to the creature safe in its pod below, and the winds and voice vanished. Was he hallucinating? He required more sleep. 
A rock began to wedge into Hojo’s throat, and he swallowed, but it remained. 
“I’m fine. Just a little tired. I haven’t been getting much sleep lately,” he put it lamely. 
Fare grinned. “Amazing isn’t it?” 
He then stepped forward, and took to the slope, half sliding and half stepping as he passed the dozen of men delicately extracting the pod from the earth. Pickaxes, drills, brushes, water, shovels, it was all used to unearth such a finding. Hojo left his mouth open as he almost tripped over one too many times. He got closer, and then his hands started to go numb. 
Help me.
There it was again, that luscious voice. Hojo gasped to it, darting his head up and around, but all he saw were workers with hard hats. 
“Did you hear that?” Hojo nervously asked Fare. 
He was given an odd look, Fare lifting one blond brow up. 
“Hear what?”
“A beautiful voice.”
This got Fare to laugh, his wide mouth up to the tall, crystal ceiling, laughing so hard until Hojo thought shards would fall and impale them. 
“You’ve been spending too much time in your lab, haven’t you? You need to get out more, get laid. Speaking of, that’s the main reason why I brought you here.”
Fare scooted closer to Hojo to put an arm around his shoulder, and they both awed over the specimen just a few inches from their feet, gazing down at it like it was Snow White sleeping in her coffin. 
“You’re the smartest scientist I know. Hell, you’ve been the top of our classes. I was jealous,” Fare began. 
Hojo frowned. 
Was jealous, his thoughts echoed. 
“My company is starting this whole new project for just this discovery. They are a weapon’s company, but they have a great research division. As head of that division, I was able to convince the heads to fund this.” 
Fare then sighed, and he slipped his arm off Hojo, just to take his square glasses and rubbed them with a cloth he pulled from his pocket. 
“Look, Eriko, I know you’ve been looking for work, and I need a partner. With this specimen, something that’s never been discovered before, we could be working on this for decades. So, what do you say?” 
Hojo swallowed. That rock was still in his throat, even as he turned to gawk at Fare. 
“You want me on this project?”
Fare smiled so wide, his dark blond mustache seemed to have jiggled. 
“Of course!”
Hojo turned his attention to the unknown alien, squining to see her face through the frosted glass. 
Say yes.
Again, he heard it, and eventually came to the conclusion, that perhaps it was this alien speaking to him. It had to be. Hojo wasn’t a man of fantasies, so he was in disbelief when he heard it speak to him in thought. 
His mouth and lips dried, left too long open, and he finally licked them, his chin trembling. 
The alien’s pod glimmered in reflection from his glasses, the man behind them suddenly possessed without even realizing it. He saw her, the alien, open her eyes. They glowed like bright rubies in her sockets, and her plump blue lips curved upward. 
Slowly, she sat up, rising from her bed, her tentacles wiggling to life like snakes. 
“You know, what’s so interesting about this finding is how I accidentally found it. Even though it seemed to have fallen from space, this cave was sealed off by crystal. I’ve been mining for stones here for two years, when I found this place. It’s as if, someone or something kept this creature hidden on purpose. Or maybe it was the Planet’s natural formation around the pod. I can’t say,” Fare wondered aloud, his thoughts mulled, fingers playing with his mustache. Hojo was so entranced by his possessed thoughts, he almost didn’t hear any of that. He saw her floating out of her tomb, and wondered if Fare saw it, too. 
Soft, cold hands reached, and delicate fingers played with Hojo’s cheek. 
Join me.
Hojo saw how her full lips puckered up at him, how her red eyes gave him a longing look. Her hair flowed long and white. An angel. 
He blinked, and she was gone. Nothing but back with Fare as though it was all in his imagination. 
Hojo swallowed again, slowly perspiring, and he looked to Fare. 
“Yes. I will join you,” he confirmed without hesitation. 
Little did Hojo know, this was only the start of the shit show he was about to unleash. 
He was her fist puppet.

The Senate moved to launch all nine rescue vessels within the next twelve hours. I will not be on any of them. I could be, of course, but that would require leaving some clueless idiot to acquaint himself with our ever-approaching neighbor. If there is one thing I am sure of, it is that I will not be leaving my life’s work in the hands of an incompetent intern who couldn’t tell the difference between a boson and a fermion if he tried. No. This black hole demands innovation. It demands me - and if I am the only one to discover its majesty, so be it. The dimwits on the vessels won’t know how to interpret my data anyway. Not properly, at least.
“Has anyone been in contact with Dr. Hollow?”
“No, he locked himself in his lab and said that anyone who disturbed him would be ‘so thoroughly obliterated even their atoms would be useless to the universe.’”
“Charming. But this is about his daughter.”
“Evil Einstein has a daughter?”
“Yes. And she’s not on her assigned ship.”
“Kids like to hide. I’m sure she’s fine.”
“She’s not a kid.”
“You’re worried about a grown adult?”
“She’s…challenged.”
“So that’s why I don’t know her. Figures he would keep something like that hidden.”
“Just shut up and get him on the phone now.”
“He’s not gonna answer.”
“Do it.”

My preparations are complete. I have confirmed that comms with the lead vessel are operational, as I knew they would be. I designed the system. I had to give them something. Their egos would simply not accept that my data will forever be over their heads. Well, most of their heads. There is, potentially, one exception. No less than ten clocks have been placed throughout my lab - all within visual range. The time dilution began long ago - but mine will soon be relative to that of the vessels, which will be of minor interest. What is far more intriguing, howev-
“There is absolutely no situation in which you calling me would be permittable.”
“Your daughter is missing.”
“How could you let this happen?”
“She wasn’t my responsibility.”
“She was someone’s. And you’re all the same. Incompetent fools. Can’t even keep track of a twenty-two-year-old girl.”
“Her caretaker says she’s smart. That she can always get away if she wants to.”
“Of course her intelligence baffles your own. That was never the question. Find her.”

There has been a wrench in my plans. Human error, as it always is. I eagerly await the day I am rid of them. April, unfortunately, does not have the privilege of abandoning the dimwits. They need her, and, as much as it pains me to admit it, she needs them. She is their only hope in finding a permanent home, although I’m not sure the imbeciles will realize it in time. The vessels will likely run out of fuel before a proper environment is discovered, but it is either that or be swallowed by a black hole. April deserves better. Her mind has so much to give - even if her body prevents its expression.
“That went well.”
“I thought I told you to shut up.”
“What’s wrong with the girl, anyway?”
“No one really knows exactly, and it’s not like he tells me everything.”
“But you’re told a lot more than the rest of us lab goons.”
“Yes, well, she’s mute. And she has a way with people. It’s almost…manipulative.”
“Sounds like a creepy chick.”
“Doesn’t matter. We need to find her. I’ll send the usual search team. They don’t have long this time.”
Journal Entry 520
Time Remaining: 01:27.32
I have yet to receive word regarding April, and with the seconds ticking by in every corner of my vision, I am beginning to feel like a madman. Perhaps I have already crossed that bridge. Elizabeth would say I have. She is constantly cleaning up my messes. I may have treated her too harshly over the phone. After all, supervising April is not supposed to be among her professional duties. If NGC 4889 consumes me before I discover the status of my daughter’s safety, I could be pondering her whereabouts for eternity. That is something I simply cannot allow. The search team Elizabeth undoubtedly sent for is taking too long. I must take matters into my own hands. 
“Liz, the alarm was tripped in Lab #1. Who would be crazy enough to disturb the doc right now?”
“Old news. How are you on the security team?”
“Not supposed to be - I’m covering for Tanho. You don’t seem very concerned.”
“It wasn’t a breach. Dr. Hollow left.”
“He left. With an hour and a half to go? I don’t think so.”
“He’s looking for April. Says he can’t venture into eternity without knowing she’s safe.”
“Okay, one: that’s really sweet. And two: he doesn’t know he’ll be in there forever. What about his theory of coming out the other end to a universe parallel to our own?”
“It’s just a theory. In either case, I’m sure he just doesn’t want concern for her to be clogging up his mind.”
“That’s less sweet.”
Journal Entry 521
Time Remaining: 00:00:58
I have just made a terrible decision. Although, there wasn’t really anything to decide. I had no choice. April remains missing. I, along with every able-bodied clod among the fleet, scoured all nine vessels, as well as the surrounding five-mile radius, until we were forced to launch just over four minutes ago. I can only watch NGC 4889 engulf my planet from the prison I sentenced myself to. I can almost hear the dark monster’s booming laugh as it sees the state to which I have been reduced. It never demanded me. It hardly recognizes me. I will never know its secrets, and it never feared I would. I can only hope that April is hiding in a vent or neglected corner somewhere on this godforsaken ship. Otherwise, this is all for naught. 
“Doctor, I’m sorry to interrupt your writing, but our scans picked up one life form still on the planet. Did you opt to send someone as your proxy?”
“Dr. Hollow?”
“Who is unaccounted for, Elizabeth?”
“Just your daughter, sir.”
“Get her on comms, dammit!”
“She won’t be able to relay any informa-”
“I don’t care about the goddamn data, woman; I want to speak to my daughter!”

Time Remaining: - 00:02:07
April took my place. No one can tell me how she managed to slip into my lab - no one even knows when it could have happened. All I could say was goodbye, and I will never know if she heard me.

Mina Montgomery - 35 Chestnut St, The Eldervai Lab 
August 31, 1989
Sam and Kate Montgomery
51 Pine Avenue
Doortree City, Wisconsin 54101
Dearest Mom and Dad,
I am well aware that your faith in my scientific endeavors has been dwindling. However, I am writing to inform you that after nearly a decade of intensive study and experiment, I have created something truly prodigious! I have created a creature that the whole world will one day marvel at, a creature so grand, so beautiful, so magnificently unexpected that you can only hope I forgive you for your doubts. 
I created a winged pig, a flying pig! Her name is Mina 2, after myself, of course, and I intend to study her. I spent years of my life cross-breeding cells, and at long last, I have found the perfect combination. Birds with curled tails, pigs covered in feathers, nothing with the power of flight until today! I shall recount my day for you in full so that you may feel as though you accompanied me, the woman whose name will be in the papers worldwide, on this remarkable journey: 
I was eating breakfast without the radio on. I sometimes prefer to think silently while I eat, but thinking is a detriment if one doesn’t have a clear mind, and, dear parents, my mind was all but clear that day. I was on the precipice of one of the greatest scientific discoveries in the modern world. My specimen, for lack of a better phrase, was incubating in my lab. I could no longer bear the silence, so I listened to the radio. 
On Elksville’s local news station, my beloved town was reported as falling into disarray. Our local protestor, Sharlameign Jonsnow, was rioting at Midpark, claiming something about car theft. But the part of the news story I was focusing on was the part about the trees growing legs! For, I thought, certainly a tree cannot grow legs. He is surely imagining things and, let’s be honest, he is rather unreliable so who am I to believe a recounting of his words? I needed to see for myself, as nobody can truly know anything unless they have done just that. 
I left in a hurry, only realizing I had forgotten my shoes when I stepped onto the scorching hot concrete, nearly burning off my toeprints. I tightened the Velcro on my sneakers and was off! I pushed past the crowd and took a shortcut through some sandboxes to the front of the pack where Jonsnow and the news crew were huddled. 
To my surprise, the trees really did have legs! Legs like tree roots, woody and rugged, they were walking around, the same as people, trampling picnics and sandcastles left and right. I reached for my camera and found that it wasn’t there! A woman nearby had a camera, and miraculously she let me buy it from her for only a hundred dollars! Camera in hand, I snapped as many photos as I could. The camera was primitive compared to those of my own design, but I clicked away regardless.
I documented findings on my arms because I hadn't brought any paper. It’s lucky that I’m ambidextrous since I certainly needed the space of both arms for everything I observed. When I’d completed my observations, I returned to the Eldervai and plugged the camera into my computer for further investigation. I noticed something odd: the roots of the tree were all cloven. You may be thinking, what’s abnormal about this? The split roots looked like those of pig hooves! And what is the very thing I nucleated just before this event? A flying pig! I couldn’t deny the likelihood of a connection between the two occurrences. 
I hardly slept that night between thinking about the trees and my great invention incubating in the same building I laid in. I got up early, running on four hours of sleep, and decided to go into town and see if anything else out of the ordinary was going on.
There was something that struck me deeply: every food establishment I passed had taken all bacon, and some all meat products, off of the menu. My favorite restaurant, Pigs ‘n Blankets, had closed its doors entirely! I was shocked at the strange, meat-related phenomena. If I thought I was flabbergasted before, it was nothing to how I’d feel upon seeing Velveeta Smith the local coot dancing on a picnic table. Interpretive dance was Velveeta’s preferred method of communication. Some around town said they’d never heard her speak. I inquired if she’d seen anything abnormal, but she just danced at me. Through quite a bit of miming and prompting, I managed to gather the following information: the dance was a tribute to a pig god, Master Swinesworth, with whom she’d had an encounter earlier that day where he told her that I had summoned him. I doubted her, and myself, for how on earth could I have caused the summoning of such a creature? Surely not the invention of Mina 2? 
Disappointed that I hadn’t gotten more leads after hours of searching, I headed home. On my way, I stopped into the Nicky B’s a block over from Pigs ‘n Blankets to get a dipped cone in a feeble attempt to ease my stress. I was approaching the Eldervai when what stood before made me drop my dessert. Before my eyes stood, or rather floated, four feet up from the ground, towering at least six more, who could be mistaken for none other than Master Swinesworth, exactly as Velveeta had described to me earlier in the day. 
Master Swinesworth wore a suit jacket with a gold vest beneath it, large angel-like wings protruding from the back. Atop his head sat a hat, the band colored to match the vest. He had a monocle as well, but no shoes, exposing cloven hooves.
“Mina Montgomery,” he said to me, voice cracked and quippy. “For so long have I waited to return to Elksville. Oh, how good it is to be back.” 
“Did I summon you? Are you my fault, as Velveeta said?”
“Fault… such a negative word. To put it simply, yes, you summoned me.” He spoke with oinks between his words. 
“How?” I paused, the great hog simply looking down at me. “Mina 2,” I said, under my breath, realizing the error of my ways. My invention, my beautifully advanced creation, causing chaos across town, and now this! A six foot tall, three foot wide floating pig in tops and tails! You can imagine my horror upon this realization! “Wherever did you come from?” 
“The Swine Dimension, where else, dear human?” He paused and floated around me. I’d never seen a pig with fangs. The ends were discolored from years of bloodstains. “Picture yourself, down in the lab. It’s morgue-like. You pace, heels clicking in the eerie silence. Your eyes rest on me, Mina 2. Eyes shut, but I am not dead, I am merely in a deep slumber, dormant for thousands of years. Eyes pop open, I come alive once again to finish what I started, leaving behind my former pork-chop body and expanding into the great hog I fly before you as today!”
I put my hands over my face, ashamed at what I had done. I thought my creation was brilliant, and while the craftsmanship was unrivaled, it summoned a devilish creature whose intentions I could only dread. Hesitantly, hoping to appease him, I inquired: “What do you want with me?”
“I’ve come to rid the world of carnivores, meat eaters! They dare prey on me and my peers? Not as long as I’m around, for I shall eat every last one!” His nose began to twitch, beady eyes darkening on me. Quietly, he continued: “Meat. Eater. My own summoner!” He pounced on me, and I barely made it out of the way. I rushed off, attempting to photograph him as I ran. He followed, zooming through the air towards me, screaming my name. I made it inside a few meters ahead of him and bolted the door. I pulled the emergency activation lever, a device of my own invention that would surround my house and create a protective barrier. 
I waited behind the door, praying that my device would keep Master Swinesworth away until I had figured out what to do about the havoc I had wreaked. I heard banging, but it dissipated, and through the window, I saw that the brute had turned away and was moving quickly. I knew he must be on the prowl for other meat eaters.
I then went down to my lab to check on the incubation chamber where Mina 2, or Master Swinesworth as he was now known, had been. The case was empty. Shattered. I decided to consult research on godly beings across cultures to see if I could find out anything else about Master Swinesworth. Alas, I found no trace of him throughout all of history except a very small scribble in the bottom of a book about worshiping practices that used to be common in Elksville.
The scribble was barely legible, but I deciphered it as “vegetable protection.” I created a vegetable concentrate to use to keep my carnivorous scent untraceable. I rummaged through my kitchen and brought down to the lab with me everything with even trace amounts of vegetables. Every soup, salad, and sandwich, even old carrots in the crisper permanently vacationed with me to the lab. I crushed and boiled them down. Like magic, I was producing vial after vial of their concentrate. I collected the stuff in Erlenmeyers. Frankly, I couldn’t believe that I had the amount of vegetables needed to produce so much. I rummaged through my drawers to find a spray bottle and washed it thoroughly before pouring the vegetable purees into the bottle in color order, just for the heck of it. 
The radio rattled as I worked and my horror grew as reporters remarked on a giant floating pig gobbling up pedestrians with no remorse. Names of people I knew were listed off as victims to Swinesworth’s attacks. I had to hurry.
Upstairs, I donned one of dad’s old polo shirts, one of my many pocketed lab coats, and strapped the vegetable spray inside after spritzing myself. I decided there was no better way to stop the tyranny of Master Swinesworth than to follow him and see what I could learn. I locked up the Eldervai, protective measures engaged, and set out. I hadn’t a clue where to find him, but I started at locations that were not pig-friendly. Though it appeared shut down for good, I went to Pigs ‘n Blankets to assess the situation there. I saw something that not only sparked my interest, but seemed a monumental clue. A small creature, formed of bacon bits, which I later would find out through my investigations was called a sned, was walking before me. The bacon minion caught nary a glimpse of me. I followed it back to its hideout: the cave in which Master Swinesworth had taken refuge. 
It took the rest of the day before the boar vacated the space. In my haste, I’d made a commoner’s mistake and forgotten a light! Through the dim natural light, I saw faded inscriptions. I squinted but I knew I’d never get all the information I needed with how much of the cave I was unable to see. I felt around on my person and remembered the camera in my pocket! Though it didn’t have a light on it, it did have a flash. I snapped photo after photo, lighting my way around the cave to make sure I had photographs of everything inside. When I’d documented sufficiently, I returned home.
I walked quickly, desperate to upload the photos to my computer and investigate them. I rifled through drawers to find a cord that would connect my computer to the camera. I waited impatiently as the photos uploaded. When it was finished, I looked through them and read the writings on the cave walls that I hadn’t been able to read in the aforementioned darkness. 
There was ancient artwork of the sneds and a riddle, or perhaps a limerick, telling me of Master Swinesworth’s history and, to my excitement, how to vanquish him forever.
“Banished to the evils of the Swine Dimension
Is a creature of who came of great conception
Terrible are his plans for elsewhere
A brave one must stop him, if they dare
Reincarnated by the bringing of a pig with wings
Destroy a creature of the same, of all things
Sacrifice the winged beast
And The Hog will vanish, forever deceased”
Upon this discovery I knew what I must do. To send Master Swinesworth back through the dimensional gate, I had to create another flying pig, Mina 3, and then sacrifice it before the creature. Of course, I worried that creating a second flying pig would summon another like Master Swinesworth. I concluded that since I didn’t have much time to think of another solution, creating Mina 3 was my best bet, especially since it was so unlikely there was another pig demon whose soul was in another dimension waiting to inhabit a vessel in the earth dimension. 
I scanned through the other photographs and found nothing much of immediate interest, so I began to work on Mina 3. I referenced the journal I had kept throughout the process of creating Mina 2 and followed my own instructions. It took all night and most of the morning, as well as half a container of Folgers, for me to finish the procedure. Depressingly, Mina 3 needed time in the incubation chamber to grow. At the moment, Mina 3 was nothing more than genetically engineered embryos in a petri dish. I placed the dish carefully in the incubation chamber and adjusted the settings to grow her as fast as possible while ensuring that she’d be safe and alive. 
I did the math, and for Mina 3 to reach half the capacity that Mina 2 had, it would take another eight hours in the incubation tank. It was risky to grow her with such speed, but I needed the aerial piglet. I stared at the ceiling, counting the bumps in the stucco. How was I to think of anything but the damage I had caused? The otherworldly properties unleashed by my creation not only caused trees to become sentient, they also caused a demon hog to return to this dimension! What else was I to do but mope at the damage I had caused? 
Eight hours later, Mina 3 was ready for me to begin the sacrifice. I took Mina 3 from the incubation chamber, still asleep, and cradling her like a baby, grabbed a few things from the kitchen, and headed off. I predicted that Master Swinesworth would be in his cave. I took a deep breath and crept inside behind a trail of sneds. I heard a huge sniff and the shadow of Master Swinesworth approached me.
“I wondered how long it would be until you came to me. Have you accepted your fate?”
“My fate?”
“Your fate to die by my hand. It’s in my legend to obliterate the meat eaters.  Naive that you thought you evaded my sneds. They reported back to me right away, loyal, as always.”
“Funny of you to say such a thing,” I said, unrolling the blanket from around Mina 3 and setting her on the ground. 
“A sister? Brother? Another of my kind?” 
“You could say that,” I said, Master Swinesworth floating closer, oinking with delight. I pulled out a bottle of whiskey and poured it over Mina 3. The odor made my eyes water, but I continued until I’d emptied the vessel in its entirety. 
“What is the meaning of this?” Master Swinesworth snorted, offended. I watched his face in guilt-ridden glee as I pulled a box of matches from my pocket and struck one, dropping it onto the body of Mina 3. She shot up in flames, the inferno reaching the height of Master Swinesworth. I stepped back to avoid the blaze. 
“No! What are you doing? Your ow-wn creati-ti-tion!” Master Swinesworth’s voice was becoming garbled. He began to writhe in pain, his form flickering out of reality like a broken hologram. He disintegrated until there was nothing left but his suit and top hat, monocle laying beside it. 
“Now that’s a nice sound. The sound of success,” I said, the enticing sizzle filling my ears. The sneds had gone too, each of them now a little pile of ash resembling bacon bits. I left the cave, wanting to escape the horrible smell of burnt bacon. 
It was a bittersweet return to my lab. I’d created two flying pigs and had an experience that was truly once in a lifetime, but I couldn’t help feeling as though something was missing, as though all that I’d gone through the last few days was for naught. What had I accomplished, really? All that I’d made was gone. There was no proof of my work other than the journals I kept. I could make another hog, but what would be the point after all of this? I felt small, and I certainly did not wish for another of my creations to become malicious or cause any sort of harm. For this reason, I have decided to pursue kinder science for the time being. 
So, Mom and Dad, that was my week. Return my correspondence with the enclosed stamp. I look forward to seeing you over Rosh Hashanah weekend when I visit.
Regards,
Mina Montgomery, PhD

Before I opened the can of gasoline in my garage and struck a match I thought of the bucket load of bad luck followed by a number of bad decisions that had brought me to this point–     
To my wife and I our kitchen appliances accurately resembled those June Cleaver had used in Leave It to Beaver in the 50s. The decrepit cabinets had become so dirty and worn it appeared the Three Bears had broken in and ravaged the place after waking up from hibernation and looking for their next three meals.
When you walked into our bathroom you could swear a tidal wave from the most polluted ocean in the world had struck the house with the force of a nuclear blast.
Our living room barely fit the definition of a room in which one could live a pleasurable leisure life. It and our dining room desperately both needed “total refreshes” –or “complete gut jobs”—and the same went for our two bedrooms.
It had gotten so bad that we did not have enough of a home left in which to conduct our daily lives.
My wife and I had spent the last two years planning to improve our “perennial fixer-upper” as much as our salaries would allow, but now our respective companies had decided to move us right to the top of their downsizing lists.
“What should we do?”, we asked each other over dinner one evening, “this money trap will not yield enough if we sell to get us a home much better than we have now and I don’t know if we can afford to make the renovations needed to get the home into the condition we need to get the return we need to finance the rest of our lives.”
Of course, we could opt for renting, but that simply would mean giving what meager funds we had to someone else while getting no ownership rights in return.     
It seemed like Fate had painted us into a financial corner around which might lurk the spector of homelessness.
After a number of similar discussions lasting over a number of weeks we saw very few realistic options.
“I see only one viable choice, although ‘viable’ might not be legal,” I told my wife.
“What the heck do you mean?”, she asked. “I don’t want to wind up in jail for trying to secure my future.”
“Maybe we can find a way to procure enough insurance money to bring us the home of our dreams and finance our retirement years without sacrificing our freedom—if we play our cards right. You know that can of gasoline in the garage?”
“Sounds like you believe our solution lies in comitting arson. That’s known as a felony–and the last time I checked they put people in jail for that.”
“That’s only if they can prove we did it. We need to be very clever so no one discovers those responsible for destruction of the house. Just need to make it look accidental or pin it on someone else.”
“Can’t see how you could possibly pull that off.”
“Just need to do everything as carefully as possible and make sure we keep it top secret. Probably the most effective method would be an “accident” happening when the contractor we recently spoke with takes down our garage.”
We both lost a lot of sleep for the next month. We signed a contract for the garage demolition but did not allow any of our neighbors to get wind of our plans.
Everything was set, including legally obtaining all the proper demolition permits from the town building department.
Two weeks later the contractor started to take down every beat-up board in our backyard eyesore.
He didn’t realize, however, that the scope of destruction would “expand” far beyond that which he had contracted for and for which we had signed up.
One dark night, after the contractor wrapped up his work, I snuck into the partially-demolished garage and searched in the dark for the gasoline can from which I had filled my lawnmower every spring. I had refilled it two days before and had hidden it near the garage entrance. 
We already had conducted a number of garage sales to bring the contents of our home down to a number our neighbors would perceive as movable to a new place of residence. The rest we moved to a storage facility so everyone would think we would pack up our belongings and depart for new digs after we decided in which direction to point our future.
I had carefully mapped out the “accidental” path of destruction for the fire I planned to set so the flames would spread quickly from the garage into the house. Then I opened the gasoline can cover and struck that match—
“Poof!” The match went out and I stared in the dark in disbelief. A beautiful, one-bedroom, one-bath guest cottage now stood where the dilapidated garage swayed, ready to collapse, only a few minutes before .
Suddenly,  I heard rumbling coming from the direction of our basement. When I turned around our rundown hovel had undergone a miraculous transformation–turning into an ultra modern home in a matter of minutes. I sprinted into the house to find a luxurious three-bedroom, three-bath modern, open-look edifice. The kitchen featured the most updated aluminum appliances and a 65-foot brand new television graced a living room with a modern vaulted ceiling.
My wife and I stood transfixed–we had absolutely no explanation. Could we have entered an alternative universe? Had I sniffed too much of the gasoline when I attempted to light the fire? Maybe it had something to do with the odd-looking, glowing green vehicle I saw turning into our driveway just before I lit the match. Perhaps Fate had now come over to our side and decided we had worked hard enough all our lives to deserve a turnaround–even if our financial picture loomed as gloomy as the torched Cape Cod we thought should now stand in front of us.

When Godfrey Eilenstein started on the germline editing research being done at Kayline Research Laboratories, he never envisioned himself becoming a whistleblower. 
“What is it?” He asked his assistant Penning Walbee.  Penning had been his assistant for over twenty years and Godfrey placed his entire trust on Penning.
Putting his eye to the electronic microscope.  He raised his head and looked at Dr. Eilenstein and replied, “I have no idea.” 
“We cannot afford to put that into our prototype, now can we?” Godfrey crossed his arms across his chest and bowed his head. 
"So now what?" Penning leaned on the table.
"I'll report this to Dr. Doss." Godfrey cracked his knuckles which he did without thinking when faced with anxiety and uncertainty.  This would not be welcome news to the boys upstairs who were getting a lot of government money to fund their research.  Dr. Doss was not a man who liked glitches of any kind.
"Dr. Einstein." He waved Godfrey into his spacious office overlooking the ocean on the twentieth floor of Kayline Corporate Headquarters.   
Dr. Kenneth Doss like referring to one of his most talented genetic researchers as Dr. Einstein even though Godfrey loathed it. It didn't matter, Dr. Does was in charge and whatever he said went as if it was carved in stone tablets.
"Got something I think you should be aware of." Godfrey started, but Dr. Doss put his hand up as he leaned against his one hundred grand desk provided to him by the GAO.
"" Dr. Einstein, we got five top notch teams working on this project.  The data is showing we are two years from producing our first child born without being pushed out of a woman's body.  Kayline will be remembered as the place where the  first successful genetically manufactured human being was born.  When that day comes we will put our stamp of approval on eugenics." He patted Godfrey on the shoulder.
"We have a renegade gene." Godfrey opened the folder.
"Another recessive gene that won't be expressed in the genotype." Dr. Doss smiled an evil grin as he poured two glasses of brandy and handed one to Godfrey.
"No thank you, sir" Godfrey shook his head.  Dr. Doss shrugged and tilted his glass all the way back, draining the snifter.
“You are one of the most brilliant men in this field of germline editing.” He paused to make sure Godfrey was listening, “And our government is willing to spend all kinds of money to make this happen.  Our target date is two years in the future when we will produce a genetically engineer infant with all of the potential to become the next Einstein or Mozart. We have shown in lower species that this clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats cas9 genome technology works thanks to your research paper published five years ago. You brought a living breathing goat into this world from your own laboratory.  The experiment was repeatable under the conditions you had specified. Brilliant.” He filled his glass and toasted Dr. Godfrey Eilenstein.
“Sir, that was a goat.” He coughed into his hand, “What we are dealing with are human genomes. I never intended to carry the research that far.”
Crooking his finger, Dr. Doss brought Godfrey to a surveillance monitor.  Godfrey obeyed and stood next to his boss watching people on the production floor dressed in special sanitary suits working diligently.
“Do you see that?” Dr. Doss asked Godfrey.
“Yes, sir.” He gulped.
“Those people are playing God for all intensive purposes.” Dr. Doss smiled.
“Is that wise?” Godfrey glanced over at Dr. Doss.
“You tell me.” He raised one of his bushy eyebrows.
He woke up screaming.  His wife Violet, awakened by his shrieks, asked, “Goddy, dear, are you okay?”
He sat up and looked at her with his face twisted in terror.
“Should I call a doctor?” She asked, holding his arm that had been flailing seconds before.
“No…no.” He shook his head, but his eyes were still wide with terror. “It was a bad dream.”
He let it go at that, because if he told her what he had seen in his dream, she would bring up his resignation from Kayline.  
Dr. Violet Krauss Eilenstein was well aware of the significance of what he was involved in with his research.  She had been given her doctorate from Stanford University during the nationwide campus Vietnam protests.  She met Godfrey as he was preparing to receive his doctorate in genetic research.  He was a brilliant student who showed a great deal of promise in the emerging field of genetic research.  She had no idea that his picture would be on the cover of several prestigious scientific journals when he produced a genetically engineered goat in his laboratory.  That year he was runner up to the Nobel Prize for Science.
No face.  The child had no face.  That gene we could not identify was responsible for her horrid deformity.  The infant would live for about an hour before the lack of oxygen shut her main organs down.  He had similar feelings in the hospital when the doctor told him that his son did not survive his birth.  It took Violet almost a year to be able to function again.  No face.  From forehead to chin, nothing but skin.  He never did see his own son since the medical staff decided he was better off not seeing…who the hell did they think they were?  Why did they get to decide that he would not have the chance to say goodbye to his own son.  The nurse asked him what his name would have been so she could fill out the certificate.  His mind was a jumble of emotions that interfered with any rational thought he could possibly have been capable of…Gunther…it was his grandfather’s name…no face…no face.
“Maybe dear, you should take some time off and go to Vancouver.” She suggested as she read the Sunday newspaper.
“No, I don’t need time off.” He snapped after sipping the bitter coffee.
“I hate seeing you like this.” She shook her head. 
“We have hit a snag.” He closed his eyes. The child had no face.  Is that a premonition?  Gunther.  It had been a long time since his father flashed in his mind.  Gunther Eilenstein had been dead for over twenty years.  He died young of Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder the doctors had tested him for every checkup. He was a fisherman with his own boat The Sea Angel.  While he never made more than a pocketful of change, he was a well-known figure on the docks of San Francisco who was always there to help another fisherman.
“Snag?  What kind of snag?” She knew him well enough after twenty plus years of marriage that he was avoiding the conversation.  Something was eating at his soul.
“We’ll figure it out.” He faked a smile which she also readily caught. 
“Uh-huh.” She nodded, returning her attention to the newspaper. Suddenly her eyes fell on an article.  It seemed a research team in Sweden had produced a genetically engineered heart that could be used in a transplant.
It wasn’t that long ago, she remembered, when this type of research was banned by some worldwide committee in Europe, because “playing God” was not a good thing to be doing. 
“What do you think?” Godfrey asked Penning. 
“I’m just the lackey.” He shrugged.
“If I don’t have an idea, then I don’t want to splice that strand in.” Godfrey shook his head.
“Yeah, but that strand has a lot of important genes attached.” Penning sighed.
“But what if that gene displays psychotic behavior or Alzheimer's?” Godfrey looked through the lens of the electronic microscope. “Or cystic fibrosis?” 
“Jee-sus, Godfrey, how will we know unless we attach the strand?” Penning was frustrated. 
“Just leave it to chance, then?” Godfrey tilted his head away from the lens.
“Greater minds than ours have done it in the name of science.” Penning pointed out, “We put this strand in, we will beat the target date by a year.  I sense a Nobel Prize in our future.” 
“Gunther’s internal organs did not fully develop.” Violet sobbed into his shoulder.
“Godfrey?  Dr. Eilenstein, are you alright?” Penning was shaking his shoulder.
“Why what happened?” He seemed to be rising from the fog of a dream.
“You blacked out.” Penning was still pretty shaken. 
“What do you mean?” He shook his head free of the cobwebs.
“I don’t know how to explain it.” Penning stuck out his chin, “You sort of started talking gibberish and then you fell across the table.  Good thing, because if your head hit the floor, we’d be loading you into an ambulance.” 
“There’s a storm on the horizon.” Maude Eilenstein replied as she poured some more coffee into her husband’s cup. 
“I gotta pay the rent.” Gunther did not look up from the newspaper.  He was dressed in his hip waders and slicker which told his son Godfrey he was on his way out past the bay to do some fishing.  Godfrey knew he would be tagging along to watch him pull The Sea Angel away from the pier and out into the ocean. 
“Don’t you think you could stay home one day with that storm looming out there where you are headed?” She ran the spatula through his breakfast cooking in an iron skillet on the stove.
“Do you like to eat, Maude?” He asked with one of those sly smiles on his face.
“Go on then, be a fool.  Play with the devil on his playground.” She scooped his breakfast from the sizzling pan onto his plate.
“Me and the devil have had some riotous times together.” He laughed and ran his hands through his son’s thick black hair. 
That evening he and his crew were lost at sea as the storm capsized The Sea Angel. Men from the fishing community began a search.  They managed to find only one survivor, Gunther Eilenstein.  Godfrey was standing on the pier waiting for his father to return.  He would never forget the strong embrace when he came waddling up the wharf. 
“C’mon Godfrey, lemme get you some coffee.” Penning took his arm and led him to the cafeteria.
“What happened?” He asked as he walked on his wobbly legs. 
“Seems like you are having trouble with concentration.” Penning answered as they arrived in the cafeteria. 
Sitting down with two Styrofoam cups of coffee, Godfrey spoke after a moment of silence between them, “I had a dream.  An absolutely awful dream.” 
“Yeah, I get them two.  Spent some time in Iraq before becoming a lab assistant.” Penning did not talk a lot about his time in the Gulf War in 1990, because as he put it there wasn’t much to talk about.  After six months, the war was over and the mission was accomplished.  He always felt it was too bad the second Bush president never quite got the job done in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
“I dreamed the kid was born with no face.” Godfrey managed to blurt out.
“How cow, that’s pretty gnarly.” Penning chuckled as he sipped his toxic black coffee.  Not a whole lot of people favored the coffee they sold here, but Penning drank every drop.
“What if…” 
“What if the kid has no face?  I am not a strong believer in God, but I would have to say, He would take it from there.” Penning shrugged. 
“I don’t want to be a part of that.” Godfrey crossed his arm over his chest and looked away.
“C’mon doc, we gotta a job to do even if we don’t get the results we are after.” Penning slurped his coffee and they proceeded back to the lab. 
“I’ve got to work late.” Godfrey told Penning.
“What for?” Penning eyed Godfrey.
“I have some documentation to catch up on.” Godfrey said evenly as he shuffled some papers on his desk.  The hum and sounds of external machinery filled in the empty voids of sound.  In the laboratories, there was always some kind of external sound.  
“Well in that case, I’ll see ya.” Penning picked up his briefcase and turned to leave. “Don’t stay too late.  You are already at risk for passing out.” 
“Funny.” Godfrey watched him leave.  He would wait to make sure he was just about the only one left on the floor.  Usually an hour after normal business hours, the whole building was empty, just the sounds of the external machines could be heard, still on the job, still doing what they had been designed to do.
He had texted Violet that he was stopping off to get a bite to eat and would be home later than usual.
He peered into the dark place where the cells were beginning to grow according to the instructions of their DNA, their Deoxyribonucleic acid, their building blocks that would determine so many things in their lifetime.  Size, shape, condition, color, predisposition of certain physical properties, blood and oxygen capacities, brain function, all of it, determined by the structure of this complex molecule.
She had no face.
He could see it clearly as if his nightmare had gained substance and form.
The struggle would be brief, but painful in the minutes when the infant realized it would not be able to draw a breath or be able to suckle for nourishment.  
If he switched off the toggle, the machine would stop and the life sustaining substances would no longer reach the fetus.
It would feel no pain.  It would simply drift off into the vacuum from which it came as nothing more than a chemical reaction. He would lose the notoriety of being the scientist who brought human life through CRISPR cas9.  
He reached up for the toggle.  His urge to pull it down failed him for the moment.
Gunther did not draw his first breath.  
Violet told him he was lucky he did not have the experience to hold his dead child like she did. 
His father died peacefully in a hospice facility.  A phone call had awakened him to inform him of his father’s passing. When he got to the hospice, the staff had already removed his body.  He would not see him ever again.
There was a storm on the horizon, but this time he was the cause of it.  He was taking a chance on bringing life into the world and he had no guarantees of what would happen.  He was fifty-six-years old.  By the time the child would reach adulthood, chances are he would be quite old if he was still alive at all.  His prodigy would then be free to do whatever he wanted to do.  
Thinking about the child in the dark liquid, he brought his hand down, the toggle made a loud click as it was brought to “off” position.  The motor stopped.  In less than an hour, the water would be filled with the chemical remains of the experiment.  
The world wasn’t ready for what he was supposed to give them.  He would watch his name morph once again from Einstein to God short for Godfrey, but then the press could be cruel.  He had gone through it once before and even though it all had been forgotten, he could not help still feeling resentment over the whole affair.  If he allowed this thing to come to fruition, who knows what demons would be waiting for him, taunting him to use his discovery for evil purposes. How easy it was to be misled and misdirected when you don’t even know the ramifications of what you have wrought in the first place.  
As he walked the dark empty halls of Kayline, one of the sensor lights came on blinding him in a pool of bright light, like a spotlight on stage.  He blinked and put his hands to his eyes so he could see. 
He walked out of Kayline Research Laboratories without a single shred of remorse or regret.  He got into his car and drove away.

“Hey, wanna dance?”
“Sure.” The pretty brunette winked at him. He tripped on his way to the dance floor.
Sterling High School’s five year reunion for the class of ’75 and the band finally threw a slow dance out for anyone brave enough to dance with anyone else they had not seen in half a decade.
George Young, fledgling freelance film coordinator in New York City had driven down for the event in southern New Jersey. The first person he saw was Regina “Jeannie” McCusker, and she happened to be the first person he planned to ask to dance, which he had done.
He took her right hand in his left; swept his right hand to the small of her back; and she placed her left hand on his shoulder. The room fell out of focus. The music dropped to just audible. Jeannie applied some pressure to George’s left hand and the room went black, but for a moment. The lights came up and he found himself staring into her eyes.
Such a little thing, George thought. Could have sworn Jeannie McCusker’s eyes were brown. The beautiful, short, black Irish, girl upon who he had bestowed a crush since they were both 12, looked into his eyes as they danced during Sterling High School’s five year reunion.   
Now her eyes were green. Smiling Irish green.
“You wearing contacts?”
“Yes,” she answered. Her compact frame pressed a little closer.
“Uh, colored contacts?”
“No,” she said and pulled her head back from his shoulder.
“I could swear you had brown eyes in high school.”
“Dogs change eye color. Not people.”
“Actually, that’s not true. Your eye color isn’t set until you're 24 months old.”
She laughed that musical laugh that made him fall in love with her in Junior High, and now he held her tight fifteen years later. He felt her inhale, and Jeannie's warmth spread throughout his body.
She lifted her head off his shoulder, took his face in her hands, and kissed him. It lingered just long enough for him to hear her rhythmic breathing, which matched his.
They broke the kiss. Jeannie wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her body closer.
And then he asked the question.
“What song is this?”
“Are you joking?”
“No. I've never heard it before.”
Jeannie pushed herself away from him and stared. She placed her hands on her hips, squared her shoulders, and bit her lower lip to the right side, just as she had always done in high school. George thought about another kiss, but she spoke first.
“The biggest hit of 1975. Return Forever by Platinum Rye, and you never heard of it? It was the theme to the senior prom!”
Jeannie’s voice rose just enough to get the attention of a few other couples nearby.
“Sorry,” said George. “Don’t remember it. Or my date.”
She laughed again.
“Come on. I’ll buy you a drink.”
“A what?”
“A drink, silly. I think you could use one.”
She stared at him again.
“Are you messing with me about the prom?” She placed her hands on her hips and locked eyes, green eyes, with his.
“Jeannie, no,” he choked out. “I have never heard of that song. What does it matter? But your eyes were brown in high school. I know it. Are you messing with me?”
She wiped her hands on her black skirt.
“I did not want to do this so soon, but—”
She marched forward; took George’s face in her hands; and kissed him full on the mouth. It only lasted long enough for him to realize he had never kissed Regina McCusker before that time. He opened his eyes and saw a flash of black skirt disappear into the crowd of dancers. He charged forward and bumped into Steve Alexander, a good friend from his class.
“Whoa!” Steve said, his Hollywood leading man’s good looks only enhanced by another five years. “What is the rush?”
“Steve! Sorry. Just trying to catch up with Jeannie McCusker.”
Steve dropped his partner’s hand, a pretty blonde George didn’t recognize. George realized his friend’s strong grip on his forearm.
“Uh, let’s grab a seat,” said Steve. “Wait. Let me get a couple drinks. Wait right here, and don’t move.”
George sat down on one of the cheap ballroom chairs. He scanned the room. No sign of Jeannie McCusker. Steve returned with two rock glasses filled with a clear liquid.
“Straight back.”
George downed the alcohol.
“Tequila? Really? This is southern New Jersey, for God’s sake.”
Steve slapped the glass down on the table. He held a half empty bottle of Patron and placed it on the ballroom table.
“Everything alright in New York? Was that your first drink of the night?
“Yes, and yes.”
“And you were looking for Jeannie McCusker?”
“Yes, I just danced half a dance with her.”
Steve poured another two ounces for each of them.
“Again, straight back,” said Steve, and he waited until George downed the double shot of Tequila.
“Jeannie died in a car accident two years after we graduated. Just what in Hell are you talking about?”
George jumped out of his chair, which tipped over and caught one of the rock glasses. It hit the floor and exploded. The dancing couples closest to him stopped at the sound. Steve reached out to stop him, but was too slow.
At the exit door George spotted Jeannie. She stepped outside.
He sprinted through the crowd knocking over a couple of his former classmates. George crashed through the double doors and caught one final glimpse of a black skirt melting into the darkness of parking lot. The pine trees that lined the outside smelled of Autumn. A chill went through George, but there wasn’t a hint of wind.
That musical laugh.
“See you in five years?”
“Jeannie?”
“You know at the next, how perfect, reunion?”
Her laugh faded
George stood and stared out at Lake Lenapi, the body of water which surrounded the back of the ballroom. He broke down and dropped to the ground.
“Yeah, I’ll be there.”

Athena poured over the data she had received from NASA. For the last 5 years, she had been receiving daily emails from a special NASA astrophysicist, Albert, who gave her detailed readings from a magnetometer. The objects of these magnetometers were the magnetic fields of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, along with the constellations of the 12 major star signs.
Athena was a Vedic astrologer and knew very little about physics. What she did know was that astrology worked because it was based on magnetic fields. Astrology influenced people through the energies of the planets and their position in the star signs. Each degree, each point in a degree that a planet rotated in, in a star sign, affected the magnetic field of the planet in a minute way. In turn, that would affect the energy field of a living being on planet Earth.
This was a theory that Athena had. She was dead intense on proving it. Finding Albert had been like finding a needle in a haystack. He was a rare gem. Athena had found him through a dating site. They had met and found out that each of them had a deep love of the stars. Talking, they discovered that they had a similar theory on why astrology worked the way it did. Instead of dating each other for sex, they formed a platonic relationship to work out their theory.
They had discussed not only planets, and stars, but the final key in why astrology affected people the way it did. When a person is born it is the first time the physical part of their spiritual element, the bio-electro-magnetic field, comes into contact with the 4 natural elements of the physical realm. Both had been thinking the same thing about the subject for years and never found anyone to agree with them.
Athena, being a loner and having no intellectual friends, had had no one to bounce her ideas from. The mundane people she interacted with every day refused to believe in the unseen, although everyone admits it is the unseen that rules the world. Can we see the air? We can not, however, it is vital for us to live.
Albert was treated like a freak by his colleagues, though he was an expert at his job. The other scientists were not interested in his wild theories on astrology. They were there to find new planets, stars, and galaxies.
After the date, Athena had shifted towns, but they had remained in contact, often losing themselves in conversation about their unproven theory. This had been the norm for the first 3 years of their friendship.
Then, Albert had been given the opportunity to apply for a very expensive 5-year grant. Going out on a limb, Albert had put forth his tender, explaining that he wanted to buy a giant magnetometer that was sensitive enough to measure the magnetic fields of the closest large cosmic bodies to us, as well as the constellations that surround our system and how the fields would change and interact with each other. He did not go so far as to put anything about astrology in his tender.
A phone call had ensued and one member of the group that put out the grant made contact with Albert. They had a meeting. The member of the group had dropped that he was interested in astrology. That was the key to loosening Albert's mouth. Albert won the grant. The magnetometer was purchased and Albert was the boss of it, able to pick and choose who he had on his team, which included Athena.
Every day Albert would send Athena the magnetic readings of the planets and star signs. Both the magnetic fields of the planets and star signs would demonstrate changes in their magnetic fields. The planets, they had expected. The star signs, they hadn't.
Athena would then line up the astrology chart to the readings and plot it all out. As part of understanding the effects, there was a survey that she used to question a wide group of people, some involved on the project, others not, about what happened every day in their lives. The members of the group that had given the grant were also on the list. The rules were, however, no one was to read about their stars from any source. It was important that on this survey exact times were kept, so as to plot all of these things on the graph as the readings from the magnetometer were precise in time.
There were daily world events to take into consideration. Athena would attach the major events to the graphic timeline in the database that was created. These, she was not able to get precise times for. The time the news article was released, or anything else, was irrelevant. It was about the energies being influenced at large by the planets.
One thing that they had noticed from observing all this, was that once a planet had moved out of a star sign, so long as it was not inhabited by another planet, the magnetic field returned to what it had been. The magnetic field of a planet, however, changed in a continuous way, never resting at normal, as the movement never stopped. Even when a planet was stationed, before or after a retrograde, it was still influenced by the field of the stars.
Athena and Albert both lamented the fact that the magnetometer was not sensitive enough to pick up the magnetic fields of both the fixed stars in constellations and asteroids. Somehow, the group that was funding the grant had found out about this. They had commissioned other scientists to build a magnetometer, a second one, designed for the individual magnetic fields of small celestial bodies.
By the time 5 years had passed, they had collected enough data and evidence to put forward a proven theory. The group had applauded them. The grant became a permanent fixture in their lives. The members of the team kept their research going.
To celebrate their success, Athena had flown in to visit Albert. They had imbibed a bit too much booze, and their platonic relationship, for a mere moment, had developed into something a touch more carnal.
When Athena returned home, she documented this. It turned out that had she been more observant, she would have seen that their escapade was written in the stars before it had happened. Perusing her information, she noted that though it had happened once, it would not happen again.
There was a twinge in Athena's midsection during her perusal of the data. She raced to the toilet and vomited her entire breakfast, which consisted of an apple and some coffee. Her appetite had not been what it was. This had happened every day for a week.
Athena thought about it. This was the only place she had been feeling unwell. It didn't make sense. Unless...
She went to her star chart to investigate. Sure enough, the proof was there. Their celebration of success was to turn into more than just that celebration.
Moving the stars forward about 8 months, she saw that she would have a little girl. Playing with the houses and potential times of birth, she noticed that if the girl was born during the early hours of the morning, she would birth an astrophysicist who would unite astrology, combining the 2 fields and turn it into a science.
Athena phoned Albert. They discussed things. They agreed not to get married, but that when the girl came of age, after having learned about astrology from her mother, she would go to live with her father and learn about astrophysics.
Months passed. Athena gave birth to a beautiful baby girl who was named Athberta.
Athberta was intelligent and a fast learner. For the first 10 years of her life, she learned about astrology. By the time Athberta was 8, she was contributing to the project her parents were working on. Athberta never went to school, instead of learning at home, what it was that she was drawn to: the heavens.
Athberta loved neither one parent nor the other. They were her parents, there to teach and take care of her.
When Athberta turned 10, Athena passed from cancer. Albert welcomed Athberta to his home. Every day, she went to work with her father, learning more about the stars from the physicist's point of view.
The new machine was finally built and launched into space when Athberta was 15. It was named the Athena magnetometer.
At 16 Albert passed from a heart attack. The team of scientists under him had grown. The turnover had been small.
The members of the people group placed Athberta in charge. She had all the training necessary to continue what her parents had started. There she developed and expanded it, uniting the 2 sciences into one, bringing it into the light on the world stage.
Ever since then people understood the science behind why astrology works and what information was necessary to be able to get the predictions one needed from it. Astrology was brought out of the dark ages by a couple of forward-thinking dreamers and their daughter.
NEVER THE END

“Folks, you’ve heard the phrase ‘time is an illusion’ a million times before, but what if I told you you could go back and shut up every last one of those ignorant morons who opened their slack jaw to say that drivel? What if you could control time yourself!? Become the illusionist!? Laugh in the face of the primordial and still have enough time to be back home for dinner!?”
“No-good ingrates.” The late great Dr. Abrams muttered at the end of a long, exasperated sigh. 
The “great” stems from how the doctor distinguished himself by propelling modern science to the forefront of the world. The leaps he made in advancing medical technology were responsible for the eventual discovery of the cure for cancer. His numerous theses on observations of dark matter have led several private institutions to create secret programs centered entirely on analyzing these meticulous recordings. His unending pursuit for the answers to the universe has been both a font of inspiration and a source of ridicule to the scientific community.
The “late” stems from how, lately, Dr. Abrams has been making claims that he can use science to mold, shift, and tear through the very fabric of the universe. Popularly, it is believed that you can’t (or at least shouldn’t) do this.
Suffice to say, research grants have not been presenting themselves as often as they used to. At least, they aren’t being offered by organizations with noble intentions for the future, or the present either, in all honesty. Organizations that could be affiliated with the ill-perceived Gideon Blue Research Institution, boasting an impressive catalog of perversions and malicious manipulations made of the newest discoveries in modern science. In fact, some may (and do) call the research and experimentation performed here “mad science.”
Though, even mad scientists have a threshold for how much trust they’re willing to place in one another, no matter how late or great he is. Equally shocking is the ease with which these organizations can give notices of termination to their employees. Or rather, this news was shocking to one particular employee.
“So you think you’re better than me, huh? Well, I’ll tell you something, you… you prissy, money-grubbing, prehistoric, stone-smashing cave dwellers! Just you wait! You’ll rue the day you kicked Dr. Ricard Abrams to the-“
It was then the sound of a car door closing interrupted Dr. Abrams demeaning dialogue with the fluorescent sign outside the front of the Gideon Blue Research Institute building. As Dr. Abrams turned to see the intruder of his public-private ramblings, his eyes softened and his expression brightened, as much as an embittered old man’s face is allowed to.
That expression soon turned to confusion as the figure exiting the vehicle appeared to be clothed in the garb of a burglar you might see in a crime show on TV: replete with a black ski mask, a black turtleneck sweater, black pants… it was safe to say no expense was spared on the wardrobe. Unfortunately for the would-be burglar, no amount of camouflage or covering could hide their apparent anxiety at the moment.
“Hansen? Why in heaven’s name are you dressed like that?”
Their identity betrayed, the figure tried hurrying out the door of their car, their foot getting caught in the process, causing them to fall flat on their face. A sequence of events that would be humorous under normal circumstances, but only evoked a sense of pity and a deep sigh from the one standing above them.
“T-This was, um,” the figure, Hansen, began stuttering out, slowly rising in shame, their red face seemingly on the verge of tears, “this is, well, I thought we were ‘breaking in,’ so I-“ interrupted by the sight of a wrinkled outstretched hand, they grasped on and rose shakily, sniffling all the while.
After they got back up on their feet, utterly embarrassed at the whole situation, Abrams swung his arms, clapped his younger associate by their shoulders, and bellowed out, “Hey, you!”
Startled out of their melancholic self-reflection, Hansen quickly raised their head to look their hero in the eyes for the first time since they first started working together a few years ago. Since they first met Dr. Abrams, his face has gotten saggier, his wrinkles more pronounced, and his iconic mustache is the whitest it has ever been. However, what stood out the most to the young scientist was the flame that still shined bright behind those brilliant eyes. A fire that they knew would never go out until everything that should be unknowable was made known. An ideal that every scientist, Hansen thought, should aspire to.
“You know what I see when I look at you, kid?” The flustered scientist was returned to reality by the question. As they wondered whether or not they should answer, Abrams continued, “I see somebody serious about science! Someone who wants to take a pilgrimage into the vast unknown and shoot the double bird at the incomprehensible!
“Now, sure, you look more like a nervous shadow than a scientist right now-“ gesturing up and down Hansen’s form-“but that’s what makes science so great! The future, that elusive low-life goon, doesn’t care about you or me! But, if you commit yourself to showing that idiotic concept whose boss, the universe will be your sandbox! Kick the sandcastle of doubt! Be a beach bully to the laws of physics! Create a moat around…”
As Abrams continued his tirade, Hansen, as enamored as they were to be getting a pep talk from their idol, began to realize this entire display was happening right outside the front of the Gideon Blue Research Institute building. A building filled to the brim with scientific secrets that could change the world.
A building with cameras. Cameras that were now pointed at them.
“Uh, sir… I think we should-“
“What!?” A little annoyed at having his speech ended prematurely, his annoyance was soon replaced with understanding as he followed Hansen’s line of sight to the security parameters that lined the building. “Ah. I see. Sharp eyes, Hansen! This isn’t the time for words, this is the time for action! You remember to bring your personnel ID?”
“Of course, sir!” They said with a sense of confidence, holding up an awkward photo of the young scientist with the name, “Dutch Hansen, Advanced Operations Technician,” printed below. “When the world’s premier scientist tells you to prepare for a mission to change the world, you don’t just forget it and say no! I made sure to bring everything you asked me to,” they turn around a black fanny pack and unzip it, peering inside, “even a little snack for in case we get hungry, an extra pen-“
“Fantastic!” Exclaimed Abrams, “Let’s get a move on then, kid, I can practically hear progress screaming our names!”
After trekking through countless corridors, taking two separate elevators, and a slow-going drive through the internal tunnel system running under the research building, the two finally arrived in front of a pair of metal doors with a keypad beside it. The last obstacle between them, and the object spurring two brilliant minds to risk being caught by Gideon Blue security and sent to prison. Or worse.
Incredibly, they made it to their goal entirely undeterred. Something Hansen found suspicious, as they were aware of the number of cameras and guards that were along the same route that they took to get there. Even stranger was the fact that all of the guards that should have stopped the easily recognizable formerly employed head of research and development, merely made nods of acknowledgement towards them as they let them pass.
“E-excuse me, doctor,” Hansen uttered in a hushed whisper, “but don’t you think we should have been stopped by now? Gideon Blue usually doesn’t let blacklisted former personnel back onto top-secret projects.”
“Psh, ‘blacklisted,’” the senior remarked with a scoff, “you know they put you on those lists for the littlest thing? You know when I was working down at QLabs they shut down my wormhole project? You have a single person catch a glimpse of incomprehensible horror and everyone chickens out! That’s the problem with these new, so-called, ‘scientists’ today. No backbone!” Pointing a finger at the technician, he said with a tone of genuine gratitude, “That’s why I like you, kid, even after a quintillion failures, you don’t give up.” 
Taking a glance at his watch, Abrams exclaimed, “Well, would you look at that! The time sure does seem to fly! Huh… I’ll have to change that. Hansen! See about that keypad, would you? We have a lot of work to do and can’t waste another second!”
Any previous feelings of suspicion or doubt were now replaced by an overwhelming sense of pride that almost overflowed out of Dr. Abram’s number one fan. To be praised by the role model that inspired them to be involved in the sphere of science, and whose words drove them to persevere and continue, gave Hansen back the confidence that was quickly dwindling on their way here. Not wanting to waste their precious time pointing out that the doctor had avoided their question, they moved swiftly to the keypad, entered the five-digit combination, and opened the door.
Which was strange, because, as Hansen knew, those codes change every minute. Yet, somehow, without referring to their pager that gave the research and tech teams the rotating passcodes, they had entered the correct one. The chance of entering the precise code in that minute was no more than one in a hundred thousand.
But, putting in the combination felt routine to them, a reflex, as if they knew exactly what to put in and when to do it.
”No gawking now, kiddo! We got to get started on solving the future!” The voice of Abrams boomed out from behind a metal cube of great size, with a monitor and keyboard sticking out from its anterior. Atop it was a blue glass globe that shot arcs of electricity across its surface. This was it. Dr. Abram’s time machine.
After stepping into the room and looking around, that same pervasive feeling of familiarity crept back into Hansen. The doctor typing away, making manic calculations on the sheet of paper beside him. The rising hum coming from the machine. It all seemed so nostalgic to them.
“Dr. Abrams? Why didn’t Gideon Blue’s security stop us on our way here?”
“Don’t you remember?” He replied, not looking away from his work, “I called those sniveling trust-fund brats that call themselves the board of directors and told them that I didn’t care if they took all the credit for my great invention. Those brainless stooges, ha!”
As the doctor laughed, Hansen was struck with the most intense sensation of déjà vu they had felt since they had first received that phone call from Dr. Abrams this morning. And then it hit them. They’re in a time loop.
”Finally figured it out, kid?” Abrams asked the bewildered Hansen. “You’ll have to forgive me, sometimes I forget I’m in the loop myself! Must be my old age finally catching up to me, but soon it’ll be me catching it! Mark my words!”
“How many times? How many times have we done this?”
“Ah, right. Well… you’ll have to forgive me, it wears even a genius like me down trying to keep count after the first million or so.”
A million? Rather, the first million? Then Hansen recalled him praising them for their continued willingness to push past failure, even if they experienced it a quintillion times. Just imagining the scenario caused the technician to fall to the ground in disbelief.
The sound of writing and typing stopped, and for a while, only the stirring of the time machine filled the room. The sound of an office chair swiveling, brought Hansen’s head up out of the fetal position they had placed themselves in. Above them stood him. The late great Dr. Abrams.
At first, they thought that they should hate him. After all, what kind of deranged person would keep someone prisoner in an eternal hell, doomed to keep starting over and over again? But, looking into the face of their captor, they only felt gratitude and understanding.
Abrams occupied the space on the floor next to them. 
“I get it, kid. I get it.”
“…You do?”
Abrams laughed tiredly, and, as Hansen took in the man, they looked past their image of a profound curer of diseases, pioneer of the unknown, and spokesperson of the sciences. All they saw was a normal, tired old man.
“Sometimes you want to just quit, and why wouldn’t you? It’s a hell of a lot easier than… than…”
“Doing the same thing over and over again a quintillion times?” Hansen interjected, steadily overcoming the dejection that had taken over. At the reply, Abrams chuckled and wrapped an arm around them, placing his hand on their shoulder.
“Yeah, that! It certainly is an enticing option… but, most of the time, to get something you really want, you have to do the things you don’t want to. In my case, I hate failure, loathe the thing. Wish I could just succeed at something, be done with it, and move on. Only, could you call that success? Always being able to do everything perfectly on the first try?”
Then, that same fire that was in the doctor’s eyes from earlier, the fire that had dimmed due to the full understanding of a tremendous job he sought to complete, but was always out of reach, returned to him.
Abrams stood and offered his hand to the person that most looked up to him. “Well, I say always winning makes you a loser! There’s no point in bragging over something you never had to torture yourself over! You’d be no better than those snobby, egotistical, greedy cowards that call themselves the directors of this place!
“A place built by those passionate for the pursuit of something more! The pursuit of science! The winners in this world are the scientists that try to change it! Make it a more interesting place!”
Hansen, roused by the sheer emotion of Dr. Abrams, clasped his hand and stood with him. “So, kid-… or, Dutch, what does that make those of us foolhardy enough to keep trying, even if we’re still here for another quintillion days?”
“Winners, sir!”
“Not just winners,” Abrams said, placing both hands on either shoulder, “scientists!”
With their eyes beginning to wet, Hansen looked towards the keyboard and notes that Abrams left, “Then, shall we continue working, Dr. Abrams?”
“You’re damn right we should, Dutch! And, as flattering as it is, you can only hear ‘Dr. Abrams’ so many times! You’ll make me feel old! Call me Ricard. I couldn’t care less if you were a technician or the janitor! We’re equals, you hear me?” Abrams turned back, walking to his station, with Hansen, holding back tears, following closely behind.
“So, what’s to do, um… Ricard?”
“Ha! What isn’t there? The bad news is the formula that I’ve been using for the last few thousand tries is a dead end!”
“What’s the good news?”
“There should only be about a hundred different other ones to try!”
“Alright! Then let’s-“
While the two were bonding, the time machine had been humming at increasing volumes, now reaching a point where it was difficult to hear one another, even as they stood right next to each other. The electricity also looked to be arcing more dangerously than it had before.
“What’s happening!?”
“Time, that miserable witch, she’s telling us we haven’t beaten her yet!” Looking away from the machine, towards the newly invigorated Hansen, Abrams yelled, “You ready to go again, Dutch?”
Hansen, totally unafraid, turned towards their colleague. “Now and forever, Ricard!”
The pair, smiling towards each other as the blue light shining from the top of the machine completely envelops them.
As the sun sets, a car approaches an old man standing outside an intimidating concrete building, lined with security cameras. His string of insults directed towards a glowing sign reading, “Gideon Blue Research Institute,” interrupted by the approaching vehicle. The figure, cautiously stepping out of the vehicle, wears a white lab coat, mirroring the old man’s own.
“Dutch! Ready to fail?”
The figure, Dutch, examines their white coat before giving the man a knowing look, “We’re scientists, aren’t we, Ricard?”
The man, Ricard, beamed with pride. “You’re damn right!” Laughing, the two entered the building, as the sun vanished past the horizon.
<|endoftext|>
I climb the hard aluminum stairs with as much conviction as I can muster. People around me jeer and cry things out that seem to bounce off my ears. "You can’t do it!" "It's a suicide mission!" "Why are you doing this?!" I raise myself higher, step by step. Until I stand facing The sleek metal bulk of the spaceship. As I sink into the soft leathery seat. Wrapping myself in various belts and buckles designed to keep me from not dying, I freeze. For the first time I'm having second thoughts. Why AM I doing this?
When I first volunteered to go on this mission I didn't realize I was the only one to sign up. I thought surely someone else would get the part. But when I received that cursed letter in the mail, the hope on all of those people's faces was too much to throw away. the weight of the world on my shoulders. 
With a hiss, the ship’s doors begin to close around me, snapping shut with a finalizing click. I'm starting to sweat, between the many layers of my under tested spacesuit and the realization of the predicament I've just forced myself into. A bright screen switches on in front of me, blinding me with white light. Our national anthem plays quietly as a female voice speaks calmly to me through speakers placed by my head. 
“Welcome volunteer to the explorer mission. This is the first trip one of our citizens has made into space. Your job is to find a new planet for our citizens to settle due to overpopulation. Good luck, explorer.” The voice dips down to something colder, more robotic. “5… 4… 3… 2… 1… Lifting off”
I am thrown back into the seat, suddenly grateful for all of the cushioning in the chair behind me. The sky right outside the window shield bleeds into dark and empty space I didn't know existed. A shadowy expanse stretching out forever. The steady flow of stars lulls me to a dreamless slumber.
I wake to blaring alarms and red lights, and I have no idea how much time has passed. The woman's voice returns to my ears, she has been recorded in a frantic state, to add more urgency to the message she brings. 
“Engine down! Engine down!” She cries, “Requires immediate repairs!” A helmet is fasted around my head by a claw above, and I attach a cord to a ring around my waist. I crawl out of a hatch in the roof of the craft and soon I am floating away, the cord taught. My limbs flail aimlessly, trying to get a grip on the lack of air around me. 
I hear a faint click and a hiss from inside my suit. And suddenly I can breathe again. Cursing the fact that my life lies in the hands of prototype untested technology, I crawl back down the rope and wrap my cord around a pole sticking from the side of the ship. Hoping it's enough to keep me from floating away from my destination, I attempt to swim towards the fizzling engine. Bright red sparks leap from its surface. I flinch, wondering if my suit will protect me from their burning touch.
I slide back a panel, nestled on the ship’s plating, remembering my brief training, I reach for a red box and pull out a soldering gun and some pliers. I work slowly and carefully on the ship's wound.  I imagine myself as a doctor, bandaging cuts, sewing gashes back together with the utmost care. But I am not a mechanic, and I have no idea what I am doing. Probably doing more harm than good, I attempt to fuse together separated wires, and melt torn metal back into one seamless sheet. When I try to burn away my sloppy seam I warp the metal plates with my fires. 
I slam down a fist in anger and the momentum sends me flying, my cord is pulled out of its original socket and I am extremely thankful that I tied it on the bar earlier. When I've made it back to the ship full of cushy chairs and other strange machines that could kill me in an instant, I drop to my knees on a dressing pad and allow the robotic claw to remove my helmet. From across the room, the woman’s voice speaks again.
“Engine power restored, resuming course”
When the last drop of adrenaline has seeped out of me, and my body stops shaking, I become aware of myself again, along with the excruciating pain on my arm. As I raise my sleeve to my eyes, I can see a patch of my suit, starting to melt into my skin. I just barely hold back the urge to scream, the sight of it is so much worse than how it feels. I must have dropped the soldering iron on myself when I messed up, that’s the only way something like this could have happened. Panting, I raise myself from the floor and drag myself to the first aid table. 
After that I don't know how much time passes, Probably weeks, maybe months. In that time my life follows the boring routine of changing bandages, reading boring instruction manuals, and eating dried gruel I found in a crate inside the ship’s storage closet. As I work to shove the cold clumps of supposed food down my throat, the female voice comes alive inside the main control panel, commanding me again since I don't know how long. 
As I approach the control panel, I realize the voice isn't talking to me, but telling itself instructions as it analyzes each planet we pass by. Each one a blur of color and gas. I am enamored by each one, but based on the computer’s observations, there is a fault with every one. Too cold, too hot, toxic air, too much pressure, not enough pressure. The random factors have to line up just right to sustain us, and none of these planets will do. 
I turn on my heel with the intent of finishing my horrible dinner, when the ship jerks to a stop. The sudden loss in momentum throws me off balance. My leg catches on a stray crate, and I am tossed across the room. Clinging to a support pole, I drag myself right side up again. I stumble closer to the control panel. The woman is talking so fast I can't understand her. With each check, each confirmation, her voice grows more hopeful. I dash as quickly as I can to the window, still dazed. A green and blue planet, similar to my home world, spins slowly and peacefully as fluffy white clouds drift lazily above its surface. 
 I gaze down at the brightly colored surface enamored by its simple beauty. A panel opens beside me and inside is a new space suit. I quickly pull it on and board a travel pod attached to the back of my ship. I have to check the surface of the planet to confirm habitability. 
It’s a quick ride to the surface, and I touch down in some kind of forest. The trees are taller than anything I've ever seen, with a beautiful reddish bark. I can only stand in awe, taking in this beautiful planet. 
“What’s this place called?” I ask my suit’s earpiece, forgetting for a moment that it is not a living thing. To my surprise, it answers anyway. 
“Earth, in residence of the milky way galaxy. Mainly populated by the Human species” It recites. 
“Wonderful.” I smile, “Call the capital, this will be our new home.”
